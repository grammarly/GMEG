First , there are now a lot of things that most people use at home , for example , a fridge , a cooker , or just electricity .
Anna prepared the cake , Peter organized the music , and Heather and I went to buy the present . Pat said , " OK , I 'll call some of Ted 's friends to invite them . "
I have just received your letter .
There were so many happy people in the crowd that the atmosphere was infectious .
But the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same .
I think , first of all , we should film an English lesson , where pupils could prepare some group work or information boards .
If you would ask me , I prefer my friends do all the shopping for me because I am aware of long lines at checkout , crowds of people , noise ...
I would like to do singing and swimming .
Thank you a lot for your kind letter .
I used to enjoy floating on the water whenever I was on vacation .
Thank you for your letter .
But all in all , the party was great .
I would like do climbing and sailing while I 'm at the camp . I can climb very well ; I used to climb ten years ago in my country .
It was really a pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy .
I could not call my friends from another city and just say " hello . "
At my school , we did n't have many rules .
It highlights the history , considers the interest of young people , and makes a final recommendation .
How have you been ?
At the present time , for example , a lot of people have a personal computer at home , and a very big part of them also have internet , the new frontier of computer evolution .
Will we need any special clothes , and how much you would suggest that I bring for these two weeks ?
I liked that especially .
It might mean waking up early , but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip .
I was disappointed with it .
First of all because of the big variety in the store . Often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have merely three or four different sport shoes to choose from ; no , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , Adidas , or Fila .
The horrible thing about this is that I 'm still in heaven but out with the wrong person , because Pat mixed up their names .
Sometimes I am alone all day , but I am in touch with many people .
There are two Carlas in my class !
This evening , as you can see , proved to be far from perfect .
In response to your question and if you do n't mind , I would prefer to travel in July because I 've already chosen my vacation , and my boss wo n't give me another one .
It will be quite interesting for me to take a photograph in a place where I have never been .
I understood everything he said , and Sting told me that I spoke English very well .
I can find out some information at home , although I do not go to the library .
I used to play tennis when I was a university student .
I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart .
Firstly , I could spend these two weeks during next July only , because , before and after that , I have to work as a waiter here in my town .
I am writing to complain about the musical show , " OVER THE RAINBOW , " and also about the service .
I 've had so much work at school recently ( exams ! ) and so many things to do , that I 've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit .
The rules at home are very different .
I look forward to next year 's festival .
I am very indignant because I wasted my time , and it was a horrible evening ; so I would like you return my money and take note of all these problems .
Thank you for giving me this great opportunity .
It is not always easy , but there are rules in every home , and you have to respect them .
I must say that it was great fun ; I 've never had this kind of experience before .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I look forward to meeting you at the conference .
In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed , not by a computer , but by parents themselves .
Owing to all of them , I can live very comfortably .
Some organizational problems seem to be apparent .
We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs , all that we have to do is watch .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin because , in my opinion , tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in , and they are n't very cozy .
Another simple example is my mobile telephone . A few years ago , I had to buy a telephone card and then find a telephone box to call my parents and tell them that I would be late for dinner or other stuff like that .
Computers might know better than humans , but there are many things which it can not replace in our lives .
I 'll leave it to you .
Even so , I think it was for the best ; he was also in love with me .
Can I exchange money on the campus ?
I am looking to hear the news from your group .
I just send an e-mail , and that is all !
The following year , when the bird returned to his house , he gave him a message .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Another example is the internet .
At home , she is completely different . My mum is quite organized , so she always sets new rules .
There are a lot of people who are not willing to type essays and reports themselves or do not have a computer .
Obviously , Pat first refused , but then she accepted that she was wrong and apologized to Maria . After that , Pat never again talked about someone without his or her permission .
Third , I choose painting and golf as activities .
I had a very disappointing evening .
Shopping is not always enjoyable because of several factors .
So my art teacher came to me and my best friend , who is really good at art too , and asked whether I am able and willing to help with the concert in two weeks ' time in the concert hall .
This made me get bored .
In the present , the technology is a part of life .
After a few minutes , I heard steps near my kitchen 's window .
As for money , how much should I bring ?
In the next few years , people 's homes will change a lot .
Additionally I felt very hungry and uncomfortable because your theater restaurant was closed and you did not give us any reason why .
Activities are connected with the social program such as international evenings , sing-along parties , and indoor games .
When I arrived , it was closed .
After the conference , at about 8 pm , a party will be organized .
I recommend you listen to it !
Also , I enjoy walking and photography .
It was a really wonderful day .
In that moment , Pat wished that she never would have been keen on knowing secrets !
But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come alive .
We were thinking of so many other activities to relax and enjoy ourselves rather than sunbathing on the beach .
Therefore , if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games , it must be the best place for this .
He had a punctured wheel and he did n't know how to repair it , so I changed the wheel . During this time , he was asking me for my hobbies , studies , and everything .
My second was to take the money at the bars and bring them to a little room where I could see the pop star walk down the corridor .
That I can do without my music and my computer .
The show can be seen between 10 : 00 - 19 : 00 .
You could hire others to do the work .
I am writing to give some information about myself .
For jobs that you needed , for example , three hours , you can do them in ten minutes : the same work !
Furthermore , I would like to ask you which kind clothes I need to take and how much money I 'll spend .
Next to the restaurant , there is a club for people who like dancing .
I saw all the pop bands and singers .
Do you recommend that I bring only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well ?
We are looking forward to hearing from you .
I will be looking forward to hearing from you .
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programs , such as the latest fashions , leisure - and sportswear , makeup , hairstyles , etc .
It is true that science and technology affect our lives a lot .
I never forget important days because I have a databank .
Moreover , I have been thinking about changing the location because , as you probably already know , some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody who wanted go in .
On the other hand , after shopping you 'll get tired , and maybe you ca n't afford your credit card .
It is a great lack of responsibility for a theater like yours to have a delay like this one .
Before the concert actually started , I had to give out lots of leaflets , listing the pop bands and groups which would appear in the concert in order and some information about their performances and backgrounds .
He accepted and we left him free .
It 's an interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway 's work and what he meant by " peace under pressure . "
Looking at your letter , I can see many options for activities , and I realized that I like most of them .
It is very fantastic , especially the program on March 13 , when we are having a river trip to Greenwich .
This will be in the Casino Hotel , and we do n't need to worry about the best way because all the main routes in Devonport have signs with the correct way to the popular hotel .
Bad Jon understood and talked immediately to his father who was the school minister about the children 's plan .
I think that having this is a dream all of us have .
I am so pleased that I won this prize , that I can not explain how grateful I am .
It was a very pleasant surprise to win a trip to California , and I very much appreciate it .
I was very disappointed .
Modern technology has changed my daily life , and I 'll try to explain it .
I finish my classes on the 25th of June , and August is for going with my parents to France .
If we came back to the past , we felt everything , it was so difficult to do , we would have plane and done by ourself and last time .
As all travel expenses are paid already , I would appreciate it if you could tell me what kind of clothing as well as how much pocket money I need .
Famous people also deserve to have a private life .
Thirdly , when I bought the tickets , I asked for discounts , and nobody knew anything about them ; so it is false there are discounts available .
We all know what shopping is .
When I did that , I was traveling around Japan .
On the next day , I helped them build the scenery , and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening .
I am writing to answer about your invitation which I have received as a first winner .
Then again in a few minutes the weather changed , and a strong storm began .
The price of the ticket was another problem .
Ernest Hemingway 's sentences are precise but still very powerful and alive .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
I would prefer an accommodation in log cabins because I am not keen on tents , and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
I look forward to receiving your letter .
Could you do something about these problems ?
I will not be able to travel in August because I have found a job for that month .
But the best place for me is " La Vaguada , " an entertainment and commercial building .
And of course , not all shops have good air conditioning .
I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part in " Camp California in the USA . "
In my opinion , this is still correct .
When I think of " the Home of the Future " , I want to have a home that is built with a new material .
Location : The castle is in the city center nearby an enormous church .
I advise you do something like that .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Nowadays motorization is one of the most important inventions .
We have invited the students , the teachers , and the principal of the school , but we would appreciate it if you came .
You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off .
Also I would like to do two activities while I am at camp , which are swimming and photography .
The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college , so the best way to get there is by walking .
New technology and science will change fabrics so that they will change their color during the day .
I have a friend and she knows that I speak English , so she proposed I work with an English singer , and I said , " Yes , of course " .
Unfortunately , it 's not possible unless you can rest in the morning .
We have n't asked for any special clothes , so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes , although you can come well dressed if you feel that would be better .
After the horrible acting of your star , comes the starting hour .
I used to write letters , but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappears , so e-mail is brilliant for my life .
The two activities that I would like to do at the camp are sailing , which I have never done before , and tennis , which I already play quite well .
I have been a full-time student in the university at home , and their classes all require us to have personal computers and use them at any time .
The first thing I do every day , when I get up , is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffee machine .
Photography is a very interesting activity and is not too hard to do .
The job came unexpectedly , as my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event .
There are ways of making it more fun .
It was so great to hear that I had won first prize .
While we were installing the sound system , we listened to Irish music , and suddenly we saw U2 , which is my favorite group , going inside the stadium , and they played music for us .
I did n't tell you , but I helped in this concert just by a chance .
Suddenly Pat cried : " Oh my Lord , Bad Jon has done this .
Part of the show can be filmed .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
They should understand when it is too much , when they are going too far .
The opening time starts from 7 : 30 A.M. until late at night when the theater is closed .
Me and my friends were very excited , not because of the stage decoration , but because of the pop singers and bands whom we were able to see !
You must have TV because you can listen to what is happening in the world , and you can watch some places that you have n't gone to before .
I did makeup for them .
The accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is in log cabins .
At the moment , I have been to only one concert .
I really enjoyed being next to the pop stars , and I got a lot of autographs ; that was the first time I 've seen Jagger . A lot of well-known pop stars were there .
I had to help backstage .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
It was supposed to start at half past seven , and it started only at fifteen past eight .
Can you think you can have every information you need whenever you want ?
If you do n't have a problem , we await your , we hope , good answer .
The fact was that Pat chose to go to the year 2000 , and when he arrived , he told everyone that he was the inventor .
They keep claiming that there 's no such thing as shopping .
But it is also true that I could see stars and artists on stage from only six countries , not stars from around the world as you announced in your advertisement .
It is possible that only one computer will do all of this , and it will have its own personality , voice , and eyesight .
Nevertheless , I stayed since I had paid .
All the waiting made me quite hungry , so I was expecting to have a good meal at the theater restaurant after the show .
Secondly , the concert halls .
By contrast , in the future , I guess we would rather go back to the ancient times , longing to have a natural lifestyle .
This is one other important thing to remember .
On the other hand , people will still be living in a building constructed for a " family . "
We would have a lot of money from the work .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If yes , wait until the 2100s !
Try to ask who invented the wheel or the book .
Thank you for having organized the program for our class ; I think you have thought a long time about how we should study during three days .
That is exactly what happens to me .
That has been my dream since my childhood .
There was no solution to finally obtain the diploma .
You 'll have happy memories and a good mood .
It will be a great opportunity for me to see the United States . I am so happy about that , I can not explain it .
I looked out through the window and saw a big strange " thing . "
And of course , I immediately said Yes !!
I remember Princess Diana 's dying in the car crash in August 1997 as one of the most disastrous examples .
I felt how lucky I was .
Firstly , I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage .
Speaking classes should be filmed .
First of all , I do n't like and do n't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my cart ( which , by the way , has its own idea of where it wants to go ) between other desperate people 's baskets , just to find that perfect tin of beans or toothpaste , especially since it is so hard to find anything in modern , huge department stores stuffed with lots of merchandise .
The concerts are fabulous , but the problems are the halls .
First , I would like to travel during July because my college will finish at the end of June , and I am going to go back to Japan in August .
Today , however , people do not need to spend a lot of time on making food , washing up , or even turning on and off the light .
Unfortunately , I am not so good at it .
Now the only thing I have to do is to go to the computer room and turn on the computer .
Why did you put it on the paper then ?
Referent , where is the conference ?
Apart from banks and important offices , there are also the world stock market exchange , an opera theater , shopping arcades , books , and records stores .
It is normal , when you are a star , that everybody wants to know all about you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
This means the engineering will find a way to use less petrol for it , so it must useful in the future .
I was sitting and waiting for forty-five minutes until the play started .
2 - They also think that by filming some of the lessons that they usually have , known as " one-to-one " lessons , people who see this video will be interested in knowing more about the school , because a few English schools have this sort of class .
Imagine that all people have masks on their mouths and noses , like we have sunglasses , and that all the masks are designer brands , which are made of special materials to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
Thank you very much .
Lastly , you wrote that it was a perfect evening out , but like I said before it was n't .
I thought they were robbers .
It is the best way to enjoy shopping .
I love traveling when the weather is warm .
Yet my mobile phone is in my bag , and I bring it everywhere .
We hope to see you at the party and have a wonderful time together .
Is n't it a big opportunity for us ?
They have had a lot of progress in our everyday life , and they have become more important for us .
Nevertheless , sometimes communications disturb their lives in a bad way .
I am writing to complain about the musical show " OVER THE RAINBOW , " which I saw in your theater yesterday .
Firstly , I will be able to travel just in July because my class starts the month after that .
Concerning swimming , I practice this sport once a week on my own , so I am just an amateur , not a great swimmer !
Then I woke up ; well , I shall never know what happened to the " poor cow " !
From the park square , just go straight .
Try giving up shopping for one day and try spending your day with friends going to play something together .
For instance , you want to buy everything that you saw , and after that , you do n't know how much you have spent .
They are against democracy , I think .
When all the family got up , I told them the truth and all promised to say nothing .
Even food is polluted .
So they prefer to let their kids watch TV .
There seems to be a general opinion that sports , art , and musical activities such as tennis , football , orchestra , painting , and photography should be included .
One of the reasons I went to see that particular show was the starring actor announced in the add , Danny Brook ; but when the show actually started , with a forty-five minute delay , I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play .
The actor " Danny Brook , " whom you advertised in the brochure , did not play a part in the show .
My name is Valencia Valdez .
I am writing to complain about the show " Over the Rainbow , " which was played at the " Circle Theatre , " because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all .
I looked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine .
You also have mentioned the discounts and there were not any .
He was really kind and friendly , but really what I mostly enjoyed was when he invited me that night for a drink in the most luxurious pub I had ever been to .
I could n't believe my eyes .
But this time it 'll be different , I think .
My life would n't be the same at another time without this progress .
I would like to ask whether you have competitions or different activities .
They all exploded with loud splashes .
Then I want to remark that the concert halls were too small ; that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts .
Tents remind me of the time when I was in the army - I would prefer a log cabin for my stay in the camp .
Then I go to work on my motorcycle .
Before I used computers generally , it took so much time for me to look up words in a dictionary and look for information .
However , there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert .
Thank you for your attention and understanding .
Firstly , I 'm very glad to hear from you .
To sum up , there are many disadvantages as well as advantages .
You should avoid the peak times .
And I 'd like to know about what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too .
It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays .
For me , my opinions on this are true , it is boring , but it might because I am a boy .
I especially liked that time .
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I first bought a computer when I was in university .
They come up with many ideas , but it ca n't last for a long time .
Brian found out what had happened , and at first , he was angry with Pat , but then he thanked him .
When I went to buy the ticket , I tried to get a discount with my student card , but that was not possible .
It 's a boring rule .
I enjoyed it very much and think the idea of its creation was great .
On what day can I start my travel ?
The first thing that annoyed me were the forty-five minutes we were waiting at the beginning .
They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often .
The add also mentioned discounts , but that was n't true either .
I can affirm that I could n't keep things balanced without this modern technology today .
" Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , " I was reading when I suddenly heard a big bang .
I am writing to you on behalf of my class concerning our trip to London .
Recently , the exhibition on Africa just finished .
Madrid is a big city and has many interesting places .
Machines , such as the dishwasher , laundry machine , and remote controller , help us to relax or do as little work as necessary .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Using the equipment and area , we have to organize some activities .
You advertise that the show began at 19 : 30 , and not at 20 : 15 as it did .
I am good and fast at swimming .
For the activities listed in your letter , I choose basketball and singing .
All these facts mean that our modern life causes big damage to the earth .
Secondly , you have required information about the end-of-conference party .
For just one day in my summer vacation , I planned to do something adventurous .
In addition to this , the stars should n't complain at any time about their fans and their loss of privacy .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you are presenting at the moment : " Over the Rainbow . "
It was supposed to be my perfect evening out . But it was n't .
I really expect you to consider my arguments and refund me the value of the ticket as soon as possible .
Thank you very much for your letter .
But we should not forget that they are only tools and emphasize human relationships .
For example , no one said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show . It will be on the 13th of March from 10 : 00 to 19 : 00 .
First of all , modern technology has changed my daily life the last five years more quickly than in the old days , or even ten years ago .
I find shopping is very time consuming .
First of all , using the computer is the most important for me because I can store my personal records such as my diary or expenses , and I send e-mails to my friends who live abroad .
I had to pay the full price for them , which was quite expensive .
Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a lover .
One of the most interesting ones is " The Old Man and the Sea , " a story of an old seaman leaving his town to prove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever .
Although the show was supposed to start at 19 : 30 , it started at 20 : 15 , so I had to wait for an hour .
Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping center in South East London .
Why did you write that they were available ?
Finally , thank you again for everything and I am looking forward to accompanying you soon .
This , again , enables people to save time .
I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives ; however , I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or has already fallen into wicked hands .
In my opinion , there 's nothing special that I 'd like to change , maybe only this : that I would n't have to change my boots .
I would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize I have won .
Instead , there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and a terribly annoying voice .
I 'd like to know some examples .
I bought a ticket for the 19 : 30 round , and the show was very , very late .
You have been presented some reasons as to why shopping is not always enjoyable .
But in the winter there 's still a problem which needs to be solved .
I suppose it will be better for your theater 's reputation to give at least some of my money back .
I have chosen golf because I have never played this game .
I really liked your idea of visiting your theater restaurant , but because of the late start of the show , the restaurant was closed by the end of the show .
They are also the lessons which the English and other foreigners are particularly curious about .
I 'm so happy and excited to receive this letter that I 've won the first prize in your competition .
For the accommodation , I 'd prefer to stay in log cabins , because , for me and my family , it would be more comfortable .
The computer has made a lot of jobs easier .
It is called Penrhyn Castle , and the building will tell you all about Wales .
My family decided to visit my grandmother in Orlando because she had some problems with the swimming pool . She asked my parents to help her put in a new swimming pool building .
I also helped with the lighting and studio equipment .
I 'm a fan of Danny Brook , so when I read his name in the advertisement I immediately decided to go to the show .
My professor said , " go and get familiar with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail . "
As you know , I took art for my GCSE , and fortunately , I like it and got quite good marks for my project about light and sound .
He was very kind to me ; we talked about many things , and after the concert he invited all the team to have dinner . Yes , I know what you 're thinking , " dinner and Sting , " and yes , my friend , it was the best thing in my life .
It 's like walking on the clouds ; you feel like flying .
Additionally , the advertisement said I could visit the theater restaurant after the show .
After all this introduction , it will be time to show some of the activities everyone can join in at the school , such as classes or the library , our protagonist having a coffee with some colleagues at the coffee bar , or the reception service .
These are my suggestions .
But from the other , everybody has the right to have a secret garden ; the right to be with his / her family without being disturbed by journalists and photographers .
According to my job , I had to help the teams with the out lights , and of course it had been my first professional experience ; at the end , I felt like a member of the team , because they were so kind to me , and I collaborated a lot , and I learned a lot with this project .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London .
The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to have everything in order so that the concert could be a success , which it was .
We should n't forget that , for this reason , stars want to keep their private life away from the media !
I am writing to complain about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week 's vacation in London .
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries .
First of all , you 've asked me when I wanted to travel .
Therefore , electric light has been invented .
Which clothes should I take ?
The conference party will last until 1 : 00 AM , but everybody does not need to stay until the end .
In addition , I suggest that they should wear sporty and comfortable clothes .
Pat sent to my house a fax with the different alternatives she had thought of , but unfortunately , my grandmother was there , and she saw the paper ; so the surprise was ruined .
On the other hand , there is a big problem : money .
It was so nice to hear from you last time .
In my view , it was extremely interesting and satisfying for me all throughout the concert .
If you think that fifty years ago , when there were n't cars or any sort of comfort ( born just in the " industrial age " ) , everything had to be done by hand or by animal work : I think in that time life was really harder than now !
I was very happy to receive your letter .
After all , I am sure that you understand it was n't my perfect evening out , and you will give me my money back .
During my visit , there occurred some problems that made my evening completely disappointing .
For example , without using the internet , I could not put myself in contact with foreign people .
Benoni 's school is a recognized school for tourism , located in the heart of Brussels , Belgium .
and the last one . Lastly , how much money should I bring there ?
As I understand , it is very important to confirm the date of travel .
I look forward to hearing from you .
BUT WHAT I CAN NOT FORGIVE OF YOUR COMPANY IS CHANGING THE STAR AT THE LAST MOMENT .
IN MY OPINION , FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR FAME THAT , IN SOME CASES , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
I booked Palace Hotel 's restaurant for our party and it is big enough for your students .
Finally , could you let me know what the weather is like in July in the States ?
The computer is helpful when I want to contact somebody very fast .
Therefore , I am interested in staying in a log cabin .
Can I wash any clothes there ?
Painting is something that I love , and I am very good at it .
I used to play golf several years ago , and I like to paint compositions .
Please do not hesitate to contact me at ( 0297 ) 8245123 in case of need .
I hope I could give you some ideas .
In my opinion , a guided tour is essential because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art , and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions .
The cafe in the hotel is available .
We arrived at the stadium the previous evening .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
He was really bad .
Also , I belonged to a golf club when I went to college in Japan .
With a computer however , all this is done in a matter of seconds .
I did n't say anything and let her go on grieving to herself .
However , people noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their mind .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because I will I have finished my exams by the end of June .
My daily life is changing .
I suggest a refund of the full price , and I hope you are willing to take charge of your responsibilities .
I think that people will be as lonely and jealous as today .
I 'd like to ask you about how much money I 'll need for two weeks in your country , and what sort of clothes I have to bring to Camp California next July .
Finally , I would be grateful to you if you told me about clothes and money .
There will be music for dancing as well .
I would like to sleep in a log cabin please because last time I was in a tent , I found it really uncomfortable , and when it rained in the middle of the night , I could n't go to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent .
In my opinion , modern technology has not really changed my daily life a lot because I am just 20 years old , and I used to play computer games when I was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine .
In addition to this , I wish to sail . I have never tried it , but it seems great !
I can send mail to my friend who lives in Canada .
I 'm a very outdoorsy person , who likes to go camping and hiking , so a tent is like a second home to me .
Linking to the internet was so popular .
Last week I received your letter , in which you told me that I had won first prize .
Then the show was supposed to start at 19 : 30 , but it started at 20 : 15 , more than half an hour later .
It also held an international exhibition all year round .
This show is about the latest fashions , leisure and sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles .
Although it is not very comfortable , I like camping very much .
And finally , your restaurant was not available after the show .
Since the electric fire and microwave oven have been invented , their lives have become far easier than before .
For the first activity , I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very little experience in it .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realized that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that she had for him ; in fact , she was so angry that she almost killed Pat , but she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
I am so excited by the news .
I have recorded a demo tape , which I can send to you if you like would like , in which I also play the guitar .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I was in her room and helping her .
Modern technology has completely changed my daily life , which has become more comfortable and easier .
So then , we decided to access our school 's main database and change our test results .
For the handicapped , going shopping is not easy , and it can be very bothersome unless shops have facilities for them .
All the students will be provided with snacks and we have managed to book a band as well .
I will ask for my money back .
In August , I have to work .
People are used to going to the shopping mall because it is easier and familiar ; it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner , watch a movie after that , and if you want , buy something at the shops .
Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket , which cost me £20 .
And we have two choices to get to the conference : a bus or a train .
As I came to London on vacation and purchased " The London City Guide , " I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance .
I have to finish my studies .
It was last month that I was selected .
It means the Japanese are planning for the future home .
But computers have affected us in more ways than one , because thanks to computers , the number of the places of work for people is decreasing .
Second , I prefer to stay in a log cabin .
Secondly , despite your advertisement of possible discounts , when I showed my student identification card to one of your employees , she angrily told me that I had to pay full price .
I would be glad if you considered my suggestions .
I was n't expecting this prize because it was too good to be true .
It is the first step for true fraternity .
That exciting stories always describe people in difficult situations is true of Agatha Christie 's " Witness for the Prosecution . "
Therefore , I would like to ask you to refund me my entrance fee , as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement .
We have discussed the program in our class , and the students are very happy about that , especially because we will have the chance to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery .
Thank you for your letter .
However , we have to think about nature and human beings .
You wrote an advertisement that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit this concert , but there were artists only from 6 countries .
ENGLISH : The classroom is beautiful , and in the same day we do a lot of different activities . So it wo n't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there .
I am allowed to do what I want , as long as I study enough to pass .
Please contact me for more details if necessary .
I am writing to inform you about your question .
Another thing was the start time ; the show started forty-five minutes late .
It is located in the city , and the nearest tube station is Moorgate Station .
This has been scheduled for 3 months .
Before I go on vacation , I use the internet to book or get details from a travel agency , which means I could save my time and physical energy .
I have never done light and sound for a real pop concert before , and I think it will be a good experience for me .
I had to help the director write a concert script and design the stage background .
You will be able to get there either by bus ( No . 150 ) or on foot .
You can enjoy your time watching a film if you have free time .
From there to the conference , you have to take bus number 50 , that stops near the hotel and arrives in the town center .
It was really disappointing !
As I have not been there before , I am rather unsure of what to wear .
Some people will do crazy things in a situation like this .
And then , when I arrived at the theater , I expected to have a discount , but unfortunately I did n't .
Then we had an idea !
How has the phone affected my own life ?
My favorite sports are climbing and surfing . I 'm very good at climbing , but surfing , I need some practice .
On the last day , we have arranged a small party in the hotel . Then we are all set up to go sightseeing in Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for the airport .
People buy and buy unnecessary things , but , when they return to their houses , they can see an empty wallet .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need .
When you are tired after looking around , you might want to buy drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical things , you might as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things that are more modern .
It seemed to be the most interesting lesson , because students always make some mistake while they are practicing with their partner , in spite of having been told by teacher ten times .
I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theater .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
People must get some rest often , and as a result they look forward to some happiness at free time such as a party , games , and everyone loves party , it should have been filmed .
At that time , I met the magic world of computers .
I was able to get some signatures from them .
I think all of these disappointments are too much for one evening .
I think that my parents let me do what I want , because they trust me .
There will be a bus taking students who do not need to stay at the party until the end .
The main problem is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world .
Secondly , my choice is the accommodation in tents ; I think it could be more interesting . I could enjoy my time with other people playing , eating , and talking outside ; in my opinion , if I choose the log cabins , it will be like being at home .
For example , the advertisement said we could buy tickets with discounts , but when I went to buy it your employees told me there were no discounts available .
I am good at swimming and playing tennis .
I ca n't imagine real vacations without a tent .
Some of them are natural , whereas others are not .
Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system , and no one could imagine life without it .
Journalists should not follow them all the time , trying to get an interview or taking an " interesting " picture .
But Ivan was such a kind person that he let Gold Fish go without any conditions .
So , the rules are clear , you need to participate in class and be successful on the exam , which is in June of 2000 .
We also would like to have a history on .
We did not have " a perfect evening " as it was written ; actually we had an evening full of the theater 's mistakes and were extremely disappointed .
I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time .
We had to order taxis for them , as they did n't have mobile telephones .
The date is Tuesday , March 14 .
I 'd love to hear all your news . Why do n't you come and visit me ?
But , it 's not easy for workers , because the shops close their doors at about 5 : 30 pm ( half past five ) .
The party will be take place in the Palace Hotel . The hotel is very close to town hall .
I would prefer to stay in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me .
Being a security guard was the hardest task .
They had invited us , and we wanted them to see us stunningly beautiful .
So I am going to ask for a refund ...
This made my life easier and , at the same time , saved some trees in a rainforest from being cut down .
They need to be with their family in silence .
Do you think traveler 's checks would be more secure ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you very , very soon .
I have a baby and three dogs , so it should be better in log cabins .
I would like to know about how many people will be staying with me in the tent , and if I have to bring special clothes for surfing .
Of course , our lives will be completely changed .
As you know , I 'm in Ferndown now spending my last minutes studying for exams .
I 'm trained in climbing . I have done it once a month since I was 17 .
Well , that 's all for now , and I hope to hear from you soon .
I do n't know when I am going to be free to go to my planet .
AT seven o'clock on the dot we went there to start queueing .
Seeing that this is the first year of the drama lessons , it is not very well known .
I am writing to you concerning your program of spending three days in London .
We do n't think that , less than a hundred years ago , none of that existed .
As you know , we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us .
All synthetic materials will be uncomfortable for these people .
I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
In our class , we do n't have a problem with students who do n't like to work , because we are all there for the same reasons , and nobody wants to stay there for years and years .
There are many interesting works of art by famous painters from this country .
The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm .
I have never stayed in tents in the middle of nowhere in my life , so I would prefer something more realistic and new .
Then I was 15 years old .
In conclusion , I gave you a lot of reasons to get in this building , and I hope you will enjoy your trip in my town .
It already started and does n't have limits .
How amazing is that ?
Early that day , I went to buy the tickets , and I decided to buy the expensive ones , as the flyer said they gave discounts to people that worked at the British Institute .
It will be at Central Exhibition Hall , London .
Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for some work inside .
First of all , the name of the hotel which we have booked is the Palace Hotel .
I hope you are well .
b ) basketball and football games .
I really look forward to it because I have never been to the U.S.A. before .
I look forward to hearing from you .
I have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit .
If you give no money back , I will go to the newspaper .
Might there be some occasions where I have to pay myself ?
I know that my girlfriend told you that I was helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much .
I hope you can imagine my great disappointment .
You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes , but in my opinion , you can dress very casual .
Firstly , people are able to talk to each other at any time , be it just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant things .
I believe that everyone in this world has curiosity .
It was said that the stars and artists were from around the world on the advertisement , but in fact they were from only six different countries , so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year .
I suggest organizing the next IAF in the summer .
In addition to these , I can contact anyone I want to talk to at any convenient time in case I need him or her or I am needed .
I am glad to reply to your letter .
It is also free to enter for students .
FIRST AND FOREMOST , IT 'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST WAYS OF TRANSPORT .
In conclusion , I 'd like to recommend that you first know what you have to offer and then advertise it .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Lots of information in your advertisement is not correct .
Secondly , I would rather be accommodated in log cabins than in tents .
I like to go very often to look around and to buy some new clothes , as long as I am not searching for something specific .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Firstly , you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform .
I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school , but I do n't have enough power .
Of course they were punished .
With reference to the last afternoon , if I were you , I would visit the City Museum .
That was the scariest and most daring thing that I did in my childhood .
I had to wait for forty-five minutes .
But what kind of life is it when you even ca n't go to a restaurant , for fear that journalists will be waiting outside for you ?
Moreover , it started at 20 : 15 instead of 19 : 30 as you had written .
These days , many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern life . There is air pollution from cars , and soil pollution from industrial wastes .
We have to say that technological research has produced in our society " their good fruits , " but , at the same time , their negative aspects too .
It is a right like all of us have .
Math is the most popular subject in the school .
For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy ; we went there to buy dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATER AND WITHOUT ANY DISCOUNT FOR US UPON ENTRY .
YOUR ORGANIZATION WAS A GREAT DISASTER .
I am writing you to show my disappointment in the musical show " Over the Rainbow . "
I went to Hampton Court last year , and I think it is a great place to visit .
Last week some students from our class saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which will be on Tuesday , the 14th of March .
Take the 67 route and it will take you just in front of The Royal Hall .
I am looking forward to your answer !
There will be mixture of styles from different times of the past , so if you feel like a medieval princess , you can dress like one .
However , they were very nice people .
To sum up , I enjoy wasting money and buying useful things or not .
The concert was absolutely marvelous !
We do n't have to learn about them every second .
The conference is organized in the civic hall , so it is very simple to find .
Unfortunately , my feelings are rather bad .
Most students who were interviewed suggested having a speaking part of the lesson be on tape .
The other members of the group can wear a normal , pretty formal dress .
They are very nice people , even Audrey , who seems very stupid .
In conclusion , shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too busy .
My mother tried to get a doctor , but they said there was no one .
Furthermore , after finishing my work , I could meet singers by chance !
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the program that you provided .
Finally , I wanted to know if I need money and how much , and if there is dry cleaning .
If I had a choice , I would prefer to live in a tent than in a log cabin .
The building is huge with high technology and construction and a tight security .
If I 'm not lucky enough to find one , then I 'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping place , such as London .
Everything has been finally planned two days before the concert .
As a part of this , the leader of each group has to wear a costume from her country .
I 'm very surprised about the good news , and I 'm sure I 'll have a really good time in California .
The show 's date is very convenient - March 14 , and it is in Central Exhibition Hall , so I do not think it would be a problem to get there .
I 'm writing you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my trip when I went to see the play in your theater .
It was so fun , that I enjoyed it a lot .
First of all , I would like to say that I am very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
Particularly , I am pleased to have known the most popular pop stars in the world .
Also , the internet has influence on my daily life , because I can find many interesting things there , or I can meet with people from all over the world , which is exciting for me .
Secondly , the show should have begun at half past seven . Despite this fact , the show began at a quarter to eight .
Just looking around , I realize that modern technology has crept into every area of my life .
Your visit to the shop concludes in a long line to the checkout ( where you can easily spend another 30 minutes ) , where they will suck out some money from your account .
Concerning the proposed activities , please accept me for singing and painting .
My fellow students and I know that your husband has his birthday on Tuesday , the 16th of June , and we would like to organize a party for him .
But I would use the opportunity to improve myself .
I did not expect it .
I would be glad to be able to help you .
I hope you will listen to my suggestions .
But have you thought about what kinds of clothes we will wear 100 years from now ?
If you are going shopping , someone can easily steal your wallet while you are looking at some interesting things .
How did the beast know his name ?
The case of Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities .
Three years ago , when I was in Japan , my parents were both working , and neither of them were at home by the time I got back from school .
IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG !
The things started happening from the first day we arrived .
What is more , some concert halls were too small .
I do not know if it is possible to make any change to this plan , but we saw an ad in " Time Out " magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Generally , we are supposed to treat our parents ( as well as the teachers at school ) with respect and not argue with our brothers and sisters .
In the evening , I got a flat tire , and because of this , I got to the show late . When I got to my place , it was being used ( it cost a lot ) , and they took me to the cheapest seats , where I could n't see a thing .
It is worth visiting this exhibition , and we would like to go .
On the contrary , it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities .
I am writing to you because I was very disappointed with the presentation you have made to attract people to your theater .
I am writing this letter to inform you about the decisions I have made according to your questions .
I am writing this letter to complain about the Circle Theatre .
Owing to the increasing demand of light for more activities , the natural source is not adequate .
I am writing you to complain about last Saturday evening 's performance at your theater .
What changed my life most are personal portable computers .
Walking along a city street , it 's difficult to find parks or " green " places with trees and clean air : actually pollution , traffic , and noise are the main problems of our society .
I read your advertisement . However , it was different from the fact .
It 's seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon , looking at the river .
They will look funny !
And what about mobile telephones ?
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautiful country .
FIRSTLY , I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE BROCHURE .
I have no idea from where to start .
Another actor took his place .
So you can help them and earn quite enough .
Swimming is quite a nice activity for relaxing and working out .
First of all , I would like to say that the only month I am available to travel is July .
Then , you might save money for the things you like , nothing to do , just for the poor things that you like . It 's so funny , is n't it ?
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea how popular it would be one day .
Firstly , I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different art events .
Anyway , as students we do n't have much money to spend on shopping and the good thing is that it wo n't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students .
Another important lesson to film is " culture and civilization " so that people will know that the hostesses prepared at this school are not only , as the French say , " pot-aux-fleurs , " beautiful faces to show off , but also well-read persons .
We like that because it 's easier doing nothing than engaging ourselves in something that make us do something .
Then we can just go to the fridge , where all the fresh food is stored ready to eat . If we then want to go to work , we do n't have to get our horse ; no , we get the car keys and go whereever we want to .
When I was a child , I used to play daily with my classmates and now I am playing at least on the weekend .
When the concert started , I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert ends , they are very tired and thirsty .
In my opinion , journalists should have more respect for the private lives of famous people .
And please tell me how much money I am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodations .
That made me so disappointed .
But , instead there was a different actor , who I never heard about before !
Secondly , in the article , the times were 14 : 30 and 19 : 30 .
I think it would be better for me to travel in July .
The only thing which really disappointed me was a visit to your theater where I wanted to see the musical " Over the Rainbow , " after I read the advertisement for the show .
I extremely liked all the concerts , shows , and exhibitions , but why were n't there any photograph exhibitions ?
It started at 20 : 15 , and that wasted my time and made me feel bad about your service .
Firstly , I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival , it is very interesting , especially for the young people .
My name is Bao-yu Liao .
And we should keep paying attention in order save our precious earth .
Firstly , I am a fan of Danny Brook , so your advertisement attracted me ; but when I went there , a different actor was in the musical show instead of him .
I am writing , on behalf of the students in my class , to thank you very much for the trip to London .
I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall .
That 's why Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
In my daily life , I use the facilities of modern technology very often , and it really makes my life easier .
I was pleasantly surprised that I won the first prize in your competition .
But in the advertisement , it was written that the artists were from all around the world , and I saw only six nationalities .
One day , Ivan caught a fish .
And last but not least is the fact that famous people ca n't express their emotions or show their real feelings to the public .
The development of portable communication systems , such as mobile phones , has greatly changed our way of life .
Moreover , we always can call the police , the hospital or a doctor for help .
But I do n't think these clothes are going to be the fashion on Earth .
I can take advantage of those technologies such as the mobile phone , laptop computer , and television to have contact with different cultures .
I read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there were n't .
My name is ... , and I am a student representative .
Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not every day .
On the last day we are going to have about three hours of free time .
This was my secret , and now it was out .
We were really pleased because it was our first time in England .
This will make the festival better . I hope we will meet next year in the festival . I hope we will meet next year in the festival .
Climbing is something new for me , and I am not so good at that ; however I wish to learn about it at the camp .
It 's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them that I like a lot which are climbing , tennis , surfing , and photography ; but if I have to make a choice , I choose climbing and surfing .
They are too small for all the people .
First of all , the actor was not Danny Brook .
It will be fantastic !
I 'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
I have played basketball for six years , and I 've been in competitions for five years .
I think it would be fun to stay in a tent those two weeks . I have never done that before , but my friends told me that I would enjoy it .
The evening that I spent there was terrible , so please may I have my money back ?
If we do n't want to be in the newspapers , we do n't do politics or movies !
Secondly , when the show started , I was looking for Danny Brook , because this actor was the most important reason for me to come here .
Since secondary school , I have been very interested in taking pictures , and I have a lot of experience in it .
It could be very enjoyable .
We ca n't do anything about that .
In 100 years , most of the clothes will be made from synthetic material .
If you do not return my money , I will send a letter to a lawyer .
First of all , I was looking forward to seeing one of my favorite actors , Danny Brook , and it was very disappointing for me to see a different actor instead of him , in spite of his name being written in the advertisement .
I 'm also including the show 's leaflet on the back of this letter .
Now I hope that you can understand my request for some money back because of the trouble I had .
While there , I saw your advertisement for the show " Over the Rainbow " and decided to go .
The internet was something amazing for me .
Log cabins may be more comfortable ; on the other hand , I think that I will be able to " survive " in tents .
Can you imagine how exciting it will be when we stay in the dark and very quiet , and we can hear the sounds of animals ?
The majority have chosen history , which entails a big journey around the world , either to the Roman lifestyle , or to the middle ages , when a revolution happened with deals and new lands .
After the concert , many people lost their way home , mostly foreigners who did n't know the buses ' schedule .
It takes place on Tuesday , March 14 from 10 : 00 to 19 : 00 at the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
I 'm writing to tell you about my experience last month .
Lots of people were injured and even more were suspended the next day at school , when the headmaster found out what had happened .
However , something wrong came up again .
That fact should be respected by journalists .
People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary , feel comfortable , and stand out .
I would rather choose July because I have time off for only one month , long enough to spend it traveling abroad .
My wife and I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago .
These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books .
In your letter , you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in a tent or log cabin .
The discounts were n't available and your theater restaurant was n't open , because the owners were on vacation .
The festival was generally good , but I have some suggestions for next year 's festival .
To begin with , we enjoy reading gossip about famous stars and politicians , although it sometimes is n't true .
The company I work for works for Los Suaves , a very famous group from my country .
So I must insist that I have a full refund .
I went to London last week for business , and , loving theater very much , I had promised to offer my friend , after work , a very good evening with your musical show " Over the Rainbow . "
To sum up , technology has been a great help to all of us .
I worked all days , but I did it with pleasure .
By the time it finished , I was exhausted , but I certainly enjoyed this experience , as you can meet many people at a time . And what I liked most was that you could see famous stars from very close and listen to their live music for free !
I am a student at a technical university .
The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad .
One more thing about the show is , it 's free for students .
Sometimes when you 're shopping on the street , you will see a lot of things that you like and you ca n't buy all at once , so you may feel very sad .
After the conference , we are going to have an informal dinner with a prior snack time to introduce everyone .
I think that is a good question to think about .
Please write me a letter as soon as possible !
We will be unwilling to give housework up .
The sea is also polluted by oil and chemical detergents which are used at home .
You are asking me to choose just 2 activities .
I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us ? Therefore , Hemingway is a very good example .
They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready .
My marks were n't good enough to obtain my degree in computer science , and the exam session was finished .
During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had a chance to see most of the performances , which was excellent .
I could then feel she was as upset as ever .
I used my computer for collecting reports from the internet , and I can promise I found so much information that I could n't analyze it in two weeks .
As a result , it was impossible for the whole audience to fit in there .
What is it like in July over there ?
But the worst thing comes at the end .
First of all , as you also know , lots of technology have boomed in the last few years .
This is a very central hotel , located not too far away from the conference hall .
The boy could not believe what he was hearing .
You can see the hotel sign .
I would be grateful if you could arrange these shows in your program .
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A COMPLETE REFUND .
Science and technology characterize our modern society .
Having money and being able to spend it on anything you want is brilliant ; therefore , you try to turn it into an enjoyable moment .
The main character of the musical show , which I 'd like to say was n't the " BEST , " was awful .
I hope you 've enjoyed my experience , and I hope to hear from you soon .
The summers and winters get warmer .
Maybe in 500 years , some people will live on Mars , and then they will have to wear other kinds of clothes .
We will make him pay .
Do I have to bring some cash with me ?
There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective , and he finally solves the mystery . But I will not tell you any more .
Secondly , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
At First , when Santos-Dumont invented the airplane , he probably did n't think how people could transform his creation .
I heard them talking behind the stage .
It is also a suitable present for your cousin , I think .
It caused me to miss the train , and I went back to the hotel nearly at midnight .
It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking , computer , makeup , languages , and geography to culture and civilization .
I FEEL AS IF YOU LIED TO ME AND THAT YOUR COMPANY IS NOT SERIOUS .
I mentioned it , but they told me that promotion had ended a long time ago .
The story describes his feelings , thoughts , fears , and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish .
I look forward to receiving your check as soon as possible .
I 'm glad to have received your letter .
I 'll look forward to hearing answers from you .
I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the shows at your theater .
I do n't like to tidy up , you know !!!
Another solution could be working as a bartender . The problem is that you go to bed very late , but it 's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night .
I would like to suggest a change in the program by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Firstly , we were asked to clear the stadium , especially the seats and surroundings .
In addition to this , using the internet is quite useful , as it is helpful to have information from all over the world .
We want to know what we will have to wear next year but we want to know it now .
Every woman in the world likes the word " shopping . "
There we can see everything about the latest fashions , leisure - and sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles .
I remember when I was in secondary school . At that time , my friends and I were so daring and full of energy .
However , secondly , famous people are not " aliens . " So they might do somethings , for example , embarrassing things in public spaces or have an argument with a partner or family , and even put on swimming clothes like us .
So we will have free time on the afternoon of the 14th of March , and we can spend this time enjoying the show .
How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colors , shapes , patterns , and uses ?
Second , I would rather stay in a log cabin , because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places , so a tent would be inappropriate for me .
In the early days , on a rainy day you could n't play because most of games were outside the house , but now with technology , you can do many things in your house .
If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers , tell me . I 'm in !!!
Thank you very much for your letter regarding my prize that I won in your competition .
I 'm not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , and we would like to suggest including this point of interest in the program .
I 'm pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference .
I felt the lack of them .
Once students have taken a shower after hard physical training , they come back to real life . Depending on their levels , they have to study , for instance , languages , which I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because this enables staff to communicate with clients in a proper way ; students have to manage to speak at least three languages .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing , above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work week , and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
I know I 'm a " daughter of this technological world , " and unfortunately , I think I could n't be without it : it 's rather strange that today there are still people without a phone , dishwasher , TV ...
This interactive way of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions .
The show was supposed to have started at 19 : 30 , but it only started at 20 : 15 , so the public , including myself , was forced to wait for forty-five minutes .
I would n't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me .
It will be on the 14th , and we all want to go .
The second thing is that you should open the show on time , because if the audience has to wait , they will not feel happy ; but I think you know that .
Now the clothes that they will wear have to be smart , not as if you were going to a casino , for example , but nice casual , not with sports shoes or T-shirts .
It will let me get up close with nature and experience life in the wild .
Lastly , would you tell us which is a better present for him : a compact disk or a book ?
First of all , the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel , which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities .
I would like to travel only in July because my boss can not give me a vacation for the other months of Summer .
I 'm writing with reference to your letter .
I would be grateful if you could put me into a tent for accommodation because I have had all vacations with my parents in luxury hotels before .
First of all , in the description of the show , the star should have been Mr. DANNY BROOK , and it was n't .
The time had come the two groups had combined their forces and were ready to strike .
This is a revolution which has changed our daily life .
And I would like to choose golf and painting for my activities .
I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition .
I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend time living in tents with a pleasant environment and fresh air .
But I would like to suggest some requests for the festival .
The team of volunteers was a great one , and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed .
I am writing to share with you some feelings I have after watching a musical , which was played at The Circle Theatre last week .
We all are very happy with your program ; we especially like the idea of sightseeing by ourselves and touring the National Art Gallery .
I have n't heard from you for a long time . How are you ?
Another significant technological development is the creation of electrical appliances .
Going shopping is a good thing when you do n't know what to do , but it has also many disadvantages .
The last thing is the theater restaurant was closed after the show , because it only stayed opened until 9 o'clock at night .
In my opinion , we can have a great time there , and the entrance is free of charge for students , which is very important as well .
Another disappointing thing was that discounts were not available , which made me a bit angry .
Singing is our favorite hobby .
I can send e-mails or use the mobile phone .
I think that all these problems could have been avoided and that asking for my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
From my point of view , the rock concert hall was too small ; you have to consider getting a big one for next year because these kind of events are attended by a lot of young people .
I 've never gone to the USA before .
At that time , he was unconscious , and I kept asking myself , " Should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first-aid skills to deal with him ? "
The evening was a disaster , and I wonder if I have not the right to ask you to return my money , as I think it is fair .
I 'm asking you for my money back . You can do it , ca n't you ?
At the end of the exam session , all students and teachers meet together for a big party to celebrate .
That was a bit boring , but it was part of my job .
I 'd like to play golf and tennis . I have practiced both since I was young , and I like them ; but I do n't have enough time to play , and my level is n't as good as I 'd like .
It did n't go as I had expected and I was really let down when it finished .
So please , it would be fair that you give me my money back .
It is a revolution in fashion that is starting now .
It starts from when we get up in the morning . We have machines to help us to cook , iron , clean , and wash ; then we go out to work and there are cars and SkyTrain to help us travel conveniently and quickly .
I have n't played tennis before , so I am not good .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
As you already know , I am trying to become a professional photographer ; consequently , I would choose photography as the first activity and painting as the second .
Can we get there by public transport ?
Concerning the information you want , I will give it .
Today I received your letter , and it is the most wonderful news I have heard in a long time .
I had to make sure that every artist went in the right dressing room and not in someone else 's .
Carrying big speakers place to place was extremely tiring , but we had loads of laughs .
First of all , I would like to say that it was the worst performance I had ever seen , and it disappointed me very much .
I was very thrilled when I found out that I won first prize in your competition .
According to your letter , I have two options for accommodation : either in tents or in log cabins .
Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for a good program , which provides us with a 3-day stay in London .
I 'm writing to complain about the show that I have recently attended at your theater .
Endless imagination and development of technology will lead us to future fashion .
It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and whenever , even if we are two thousand kilometers away from each other .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions , of the new hairstyles , of the new leisure and sports clothes , and people teaching how to do makeup .
Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets , and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of items .
Please send me any information on what should I bring with me .
They signed my diary and took a photo with me .
This report provides information about Kyong Bok Palace , which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries .
During my prior vacation in London I came across an encouraging advertisement for the show and decided to see it .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the three-day program .
I have heard from you recently , and I 'm really happy , I hope you and your family are well .
But if you do n't like children and are not easygoing enough to work as a waiter , you may choose the more peaceful job of a typist at home .
Are any parties organized during the holidays ?
I was very disappointed with the performance , and apart from that , there were many problems .
We can watch this problem from two different points of view .
I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition .
Since then , I live in Area 57 , and this is my daily life .
She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree .
I know you want to learn about what I did and how I helped people at the pop concert last month .
Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands .
It is certain that the program will give the students considerable enjoyment .
I would like to see the changes from an advantage and a disadvantage view . As an advantage , modern technology is developing toward convenience for human beings .
I wonder if I can take them as well .
New fabrics create new textures ; and all kinds of accessories are added to create new versions , to refresh old ideas , to make new proposals that will last , like always , just a few weeks .
In your advertisement , you informed us about their false existence .
I look forward to hearing from you .
There are more and more retailers that are opening to customers .
When we finished clearing , some of us offered to help move the sound equipment into the stadium .
After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but could n't find their seat .
I had to bring them refreshments .
I remember when I had my first lesson in the University and the teacher took us to the Computer Center and I saw these machines . All of my classmates and I were laughing , as it was very difficult to imagine how one could work on these kinds of computers .
After a break , the band had to carry on the concert for another hour and a half .
Secondly , I would like to tell you more about the end-of-conference party .
Maybe I will tell you in the next letter !
In my opinion , shopping brings me a lot of satisfaction , especially if I am depressed . Nevertheless , it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
AS YOU CAN SEE IT WASN'T A " PERFECT EVENING . "
In Japan , I often play golf but , as you know , Japanese weather conditions are not good enough to enjoy playing golf , but California has good weather , which includes sunshine every day , hopefully .
In what conditions will it be spent ?
I had absolutely no choice .
We have to remember that they need a private life like we do .
To begin with , it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house .
I think it is also important to present a commercial English lesson , where maybe the pupils could write " offers and orders " or inquiries on the blackboard .
Unfortunately , it is not so cheap .
MY ADRESS IS ON THE ENVELOPE .
SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS , SO MY GRADES WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD .
The location of the party is n't fixed yet , but we will let you know after your arrival .
This is why poor Rod died .
It looked like a floating potato , a brown potato .
Will I be going out much , or just staying at Camp California the whole time ?
Shops are not for spending our lives in .
I am writing to reply to your letter saying that I have won the competition , which I ca n't believe .
I am happy to write a letter to you .
I was n't sure of what to do , and the pressure of everyone watching me was driving me mad .
At the end of the conference , we are having a party with some cold food and drinks .
In conclusion , in my opinion , there are many advantages in my daily life at present , and I would recommend people learn to use computers and would like to say " Enjoy your lives . "
I still go to school , and I have plans to go to a college next year .
Besides , she told me that you are very keen on knowing how my experience was , so I 'll give you some information in this letter that I 'm sure you will be glad to read , even if you have not been to the concert .
I think the media must be more understanding .
This lesson will help us to be relaxed and laugh .
They know that if I go out with the car , I will not drink .
Obviously , Ted should have known nothing about it , and we reminded Pat twice , " the party is a secret ! " And she said , " Yes , it must be a surprise ! "
Thank you very much for granting me the first prize - camping in California .
It started forty-five minutes later .
I was struggling because I knew if I did n't help him , he would die in a short time .
I am writing to reply to your questions .
So I look forward to hearing from you soon .
It feels so much better .
We will see people differently , with more calmness , because we have no stress , and we are not in a hurry to do something else .
I 'm including my ticket and this list of complaints as the reason for returning some money .
Everyone will not walk on roads .
And your last phrase of the advertisement was " Your perfect evening out " ! It was n't at all , like I have explained to you above in this letter .
Or what if we go to hear a classical concert near the conference buildings ?
What we are suggesting is to change the program on the afternoon of March the 14th .
It is as if they lose their conscience while they are shopping .
After the cocktail , the Band " Zero-One ! " will be playing their famous songs .
Normally , I really enjoy shopping .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
Changes wo n't stop the coming of WAP technology ( you 'll buy a cake in a corner 's machine without any coin , only one call ) , digital TV , virtual reality and more ...
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable .
From my point of view , modern technology has first permitted to me to find a job , as I work as a computer engineer .
Actually , my job was not really stressful , but I had contact with and access to all the famous pop stars .
In this world , where nations fight to be the better one , things could n't be more different . The airplane became the most important thing in the war .
Finally , I just want to say that the perfect evening that was advertised and that we all wished for turned out to be a regret for the wasted money .
Nowadays most people are attracted by shopping centers , which is not always enjoyable .
I could sense her as well simmer for a second or two ; then she suddenly started shouting uncontrollably . " Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat , " hurled Olga at me through the phone .
When the show finished , I was expecting to visit the theater restaurant , but it was closed .
Second , how much money do I need ?
What is more , it was their own choice to become popular and well known .
That was n't difficult because everybody wanted to go .
I look forward to an answer from you .
I think you should make some next year .
We had walked for three hours ( my mother , my two brothers , and I ) through the humid and noisy jungle , looking forward to reaching a small , clean house where a nice and friendly family , old friends of ours , used to live .
This produced a stunning effect during the concert .
Lastly , what could you possibly do while waiting for three hours for some people who want to go shopping ?
I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes .
I usually stay in a tent while camping . Actually , I do n't like tents very much .
I mean , most homes are going to be in a building like a flat .
I 'd like to practice golf and tennis .
So I think that the future home could be considered under these points .
I am interested in playing tennis very much .
Here in Brazil , the school rules are different at each school .
Though , a few of us would like to consider the " London Fashion and Leisure Show . "
I was already happy to help in such a big event as the Mylene Farmer concert .
While we were organizing the concert , she was singing on stage .
I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls .
A serious theater ca n't miss such an important thing , the starting time .
Television has affected the " daily life , " too .
Would $ 200 be enough ?
INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OF OUR LIVES !
The computer is very useful , and it has affected our own lives in different ways .
The aim of this report is to summarize the result of the survey , which is about making a short video .
If not , please let me know .
I was very disappointed , what else can I write .
So did he finally win or loose ?
In my last letter , I promised to write you about my experience working at the pop-concert .
Between the tent and log cabin , I think that I would prefer the tent .
Jane and Brian were very happy .
or asking you for too much .
Could you believe my luck ?
I fell in love with a beautiful girl , Calen , who is from Spain and sells " hot dogs . "
It has been quite a long time since I last wrote to you .
Computers make some little things for us nowadays , but at the speed technology goes , in the next century those clothes will tell our doctors our health at any moment , any time , anywhere ; people will be able to locate us around the world .
Secondly , I 'd prefer staying in a tent ; that would be the first chance for me to sleep on the outskirts of California .
I like Danny Brook as an actor , and when I read that he would be starring , I booked the ticket immediately .
Last of all , thanks for your consideration in for bringing me a present .
I look forward to hearing from you .
They went into the house through a window .
I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing trip .
