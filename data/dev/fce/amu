At first , there are now a lot of things that most people use at home . For example : a fridge , a cooker or just an electricity .
Anna prepared the cake , Peter organized the music , Heather and I went to buy the present ; Pat said : " OK , I 'll call some of Ted 's friends to invite them . "
I have just received your letter .
So many happy people in the crowds , the atmosphere was infectious .
But the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same .
I think first of all we should film an english lesson , where pupils can prepare some group work or information-boards .
If you would ask me , I prefer my friends to do all shoping for me . Because I 'm aware of big lines to check point , crowds of people , noise ...
I would like to do singing and swimming .
Thank you a lot for your kind letter .
I used to enjoy floting on the water whenever I was on holiday .
Thank you for your letter .
But after all , the party was great .
I would like do climbing and sailing while I 'm at the camp , climbing very well I used to climbing ten years ago in my country .
It was relly pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy .
I could not call my friends from the other city and just say " hello " .
In mine , we do n't have many rules .
It highlights the background history and considers the interest of young people , and makes a final recommendation .
How have you been ?
At the present day , for ecsample , a lot of people have a personal computer at home , and a very big part of that is also the internet , the new frontier of computer evolution .
Will we need any special clothes and How much you would suggest me to carry for these two weeks ?
I liked that especially .
This might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip .
I was disappointed with it .
First of all because of the big variety in the store . Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , adidas or Fila .
The horrible thing about this is , I 'm still in heaven , but with the wrong person , because Pat mixed the people with their names .
Sometime I stay alone all day but I have contacts with many people .
There are two Carlas in my class !
This evening , as you can see , proved to be far from perfect .
In response to your question and if you do n't mind , I would prefer to travel in July because I 've already chosen my holiday and my boss wo n't give me another one .
Photography is quite interesting for me to take a photograph in the place where I have never been to .
I understood everything he said and Sting said to me that I have spoken very well English .
I can find out some information at home , although I do not go to the library .
I used to play tennis when I was a university student .
I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart .
Firstly , I was able to pass this two weeks during next July only because , before and after it , I have to work as a waiter here in my town .
I am writing to complain about the musical show , OVER THE RAINBOW , and also about the servic .
I 've had so much work at school recently ( exams ! ) and so many things to do , that I 've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit .
the rules at home are very different .
Look forward to next year 's festival .
I am very indignatged because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you to return my money and take notes of all these problems .
Thank you for giving me this great opportunity .
It is not allways easy , but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them .
I must say that it was a great fun , I 've never had this kind of experience before .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I look forward to meeting you on the conference .
In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by computers , but by the parents themselves .
Owing to all of them , I can live very comfortbly .
Some problems of organisation seems to be appeared .
We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs , all what we have to do is watch .
Regarding the accommodation I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep and they are n't very cozy .
Another simple example is my mobile telephone ; A few years ago , I had to buy a telephone card and then to find a telephone box to call my parents and to tell them that I would be late for dinner , or other stuff like that .
Computer might know better than humans , but there are many things which it can not replace in our life .
I 'll leave it to you .
But , I think it was for the best , he was also in love with me .
Can I change money on the campus ?
I am looking to hear the news from yours group .
I just send an email and that is all !
The following year , when the bird returned his house , he gave him a message .
I am looking to hear from you .
Another example , the internet .
At home is completely different , my mum is quite organised , so she always puts new rules .
There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and reports themselves or just not having a computer .
Obviously , Pat first refused , but then she accepted that she was wrong , and apologyse Maria , after then Pat never again talked about someone within his or her permission .
Third , I chose painting and golf as activities .
I had a very disappointing evening .
Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors .
So my art teacher came to me and my best friend , who is really good at art too , and asked whether I can be able and willing to help for the concert in two weeks time in the concert hall .
This made me get bored .
In the present , the teachnology is a past life .
After a few minutes I heard steps near my kitchen 's window .
Money , how much should I bring .
In the next few years the people 's home will be changed a lot .
Additionally , I felt very hungry and uncomfortable because your theatre restaurant was closed and you did not give us any reason why .
Activities connected with the social programme such as international evenings , sing along to parties and indoor games .
When I arrived , it was closed .
After the conference , at about 8 pm . a party is organised .
I recommend you listen to it !
Also , I enjoy walking and photography .
It was really a wonderful day .
In this moment Pat wished that she never would have been keen on knowing secrets !
But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come alive .
We were thinking is so many other activites to relax and enjoy ourself then sunbathing on the beach .
Therefore , if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games , it must be the best place for this .
He had a puncture wheel and he did not know how to repeared then I chanced the wheel and during this time he was asking me for my hobbies , studies , everything .
My second was to take the money at the bars and to bring them in a small room where I could see the pop star walked in the corridors .
What I can do without my music and my computer .
The show can be seen between 10.00 - 19.00 .
You can hire others to do the work .
I am writing to give information about myself .
But computers do n't have affected only in a good way because thanks to computers , the number of the places of work for the people is minor .
Fathermore I would like to ask you which kind of clothes I need to take and how much money I 'll spend .
Next to the restaurant , there is a disco for people who like dancing .
I saw all the pop bands and singers .
Do you reccomend me to only take summer clothes or some winter clothes as well ?
We are looking foraward to hearing from you .
I will be looking forward to hearing from you .
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles etc .
It is true that science and technology affect our lives a lot .
I will never forget the important days . Because I have got a data-bank .
Moreover , I have been thinking about changing the location because , as you probably already know , some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody who wanted to go in .
On the other hand , after shopping you 'll get tired and maybe you ca n't afford your credit card .
It is a great fault of responsability for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one .
Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets , they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds .
He accepted and we left him free .
An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway 's work and what he meant by " pace under pressure " .
Looking to your letter , I can see many options of activities and I realized that I like most of them .
It is very fantastic especially the programme on 13th March that we are having a river trip to Greenwich .
This will be in the Casino Hotel and we do n't need to worry about the best way because in all the main routes in Devonport have signs with the correct way to the popular hotel .
Bad Jon understood and talked immediately to his father . who was the school minister about the children 's plans .
I think that having a dream ' of all of us .
I am very please that I won this prize , that I can not explain how greateful I am .
It was a very pleasant surprise to win a trip to California and I very much appreciate it .
I was very disappointed .
Modern technology has changed my daily life and I 'll try to explain it .
I finished my classes on the 25th of June and August is for going with my parents to France .
If we come back to the past , we felt everything , it was so difficult to do , we would have planes and done by ourself and last time .
As all the travel expenses are paid already , I would appreciate it if you could tell what kind of clothing and also how much pocket money I need .
Famous people diserve also to have a private life .
Thirdly , when I bought the tickets , I asked for discounts and nobody knows anything about them , so it is false that there are discounts available .
We know all that shopping is .
When I did that , I was traveling around Japan .
On the next day , I helped them to build the scenary and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening .
I am writing to answer about your invitation which I have receved as a first winner .
Then again in a few minutes the weather changed and strong storm began .
The price of tickets was another problem .
Ernest Hemingway 's sentences are precise , but still very powerful and alive .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
I would prefer an accomodation in log cabins because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
I look forward to receiving your letter .
Could you do something for these problems ?
I will not be able to travel on August because I have found a job for that month .
But the best place for me is " La Vaguada " . An entertainment and commercial buildings .
And of'course not all shops have good conditionering .
I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part in " Camp California in the USA " .
In my opinion , this is still correct .
When I think of the " Home of the Future " . I want to have a home which is built with a new material .
Location : The castle is in the city centre near an enormous church .
I advise you to do something like that .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Nowdays motorization is one of the most important inventions .
We invite the students , the teachers and the Principal of the school but we appreciate if you are coming .
You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off .
Also I would like to do two activities while I am at the Camp which are swimming and photography .
The party is going to be at a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is walking .
A new technology and science will change fabrics , so they will change their colour during the day .
I have a friend and she knows that I speak English so she offered to work with an English singer so I said " yes , of course " .
Unfortunately it 's not possible unless you can rest in the morning .
We have n't asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes , although you can come well-dressed , if you feel better .
After the horrible act of your star , it comes the starting ours .
I used to write letters , but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappear so E-mail is brilliant for my life .
The two activities that I would like to do at the Camp are sailing , which I have never done before and tennis which I already played quite well .
I have been a full time student in the university at home , and their classes all requires us to have a personal computer and use them at any time .
The first thing I do every day when I get up , is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffe machine .
Photography is a very interesting activitie , and is not too hard to do too .
The job came unexpectedly as my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event .
There are ways of behaviour to make fun of it .
It was so great to hear that I had won first prize .
While we were installing the sound system we listened irish music and suddenly we saw to U2 , which is my favourite group , going inside the stadium and they played music for us .
I do n't tell you , but I helped in this concert just by chance .
Suddenly Pat cried : " Oh my Lord , Bad Jon had done this .
Part of the show can be filmed .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
They should understand when it is too much , when they are going too far .
The opening time starts from 7.30 AM. till late at night when the theatre is closed .
Me and my friends were very excited , not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we will be able to see !
You must have TV because you can liten what it happend in the world and you can see some places that you do n't go .
I done mace-up for them .
An accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is in log cabins .
At the moment just I went just one concert .
I really enjoyed being next to the pop stars I got a lot of autographes , that was the first time I 've seen like Jagger a lot of well know pop stars was there .
I had to help back stages .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
It was supposed to start at half past seven , and it started only at fifteen past eight .
Can you think you have all the information you need whenever you want ?
If you do n't have problems we attend yours , we hope a good answer .
The fact was that Pat chose to go to the year 2000 , and when he arrived , he told everyo ne that he was the inventor .
They keep claiming that there 's no such thing as shopping .
But it is also true that I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries , not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement .
It is possible that only one computer will do this and it will have its own personality , voice , eyesight..
Nevertheless , I stayed since I had paid .
All the waiting made me quite hungry , so I was expecting to have a good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show .
Secondly , the concert halls .
By contrast , In the future , I guess we would rather go back to the acient time , owing to a natural life style .
This is one other important thing to remember .
On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a " family " .
We would have a lot of money from the work .
I look forward to reading from you .
If yes , wait until 2100s !
Try to ask who invented the will or the book .
Thank you for being organised the programme for our class , I think you may think about a long time how shall we study during three days .
That is exactly what happens to me .
That has been my dream since my childhood .
There was no solutions to finally obtain the diploma .
You 'll have happy memories and a good mood .
It will be a great opportunity for me to see the United States and I am so happy about that , I can not explain it .
I looked out the window and saw a big strange " thing " .
And of course I immediately said Yes !!
I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died in a car crash was one of the most disarster examples .
I felt how luck I was .
Firstly , I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage .
Speaking class should be filmed .
First of all , I do n't like and do n't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley ( which , by the way , has it 's own idea of where it want 's to go ) between other desperate people baskets , just to find that perfect tin of beans or a toothpaste . Especially that it is so hard to find anything in a modern , huge and stuffed with lots of merchandise department stores .
The concerts are fabulous but the problems are the halls .
First , I would like to travel during July . Because my college will finish at the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August .
Today , however , people do not need to spend much time on making food , washing up , or even on turning on and off the lights .
Unfortunately I am not so good at it .
Now the only think I have to do is to go to the computer room and turn on the computer .
Why do you put on the paper then ?
Referent , which is the conference .
Apart from Banks and important offices . There are also world stock market exchange , an opera theatre , shopping arcades , books and records stores .
It Is normally when you are a star , that everybody wants to know everything about you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
This means that the engineering will find the way to useless petrol for it , so it must be useful in the future .
I was sitting and waiting for forty five minutes before the play started .
2 - They also think that filming some of the lessons that they usually have , known as " one-to-one " lessons , people who see this video , will be interested in knowing more about the school because a few English schools have this sort of classes .
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouthes and noses like we have sun-glasses , and that all the masks are designers brands , which are made of special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
Thank you very much .
At last , you wrote that it was our perfect evening out , but like I said before , it was n't .
I though it was some rubbers .
It is the best way to enjoy shopping .
I love travelling when the weather is warm .
Yet my hand phone is in my bag and I carry it everywhere .
We hope to see you at the party and have a wonderfull time together .
Is n't it a big opportunity for us ?
They have taken a big progress in our every day life and they have always become more important for us .
Nevertheless , sometimes communications disturb their lives in a wrong way .
I am writing to complain about the musical show " OVER THE RAINBOW " which I saw in your theatre yesterday .
Firstly , I will be able to travel just in july because my class starts the month after this .
Concerning swimming , I practise this sport once a week on myself , so I am just an amateur , not a great swimmer !
Then I woke up ; well , I shall never know what happened to the " poor cow " !
From park square , just go straight .
Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends going to play something together .
For instance , you want to buy everything that you saw , and after that , you do n't know how much you have spent .
They are against democracy , I think .
When all the family got up , I told us the truth and all promised to say nothing .
Even food is polluted .
So they prefer to leave their sons wecting TV .
There seems to be a general opinion that sports , art and music activities such as tennis , football , orchestra , painting , photography should be included .
One of the reasons I went to see that particular show , was the starring actor announced in the add , Danny Brook , but when the show actually started with forty five minute delay , I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play .
The actor ' Danny brook ' , whom you advertised in the brocher , did not play a part in the show .
My name is Volencia Vardez .
I am writing in order to complain about the show " Over the Rainbow " which was played in the " Circle Theatre " , because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all .
I loocked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine .
You also have mentioned about the discounts and there were not any .
He was really kind and friendly but really what I really most enjoyed it , was when he invited me this night for a drink in the most luxurious pub I have ever been .
I could n't believe my eyes .
But this time it 'll be different , I thought .
My life would n't be the same another time without these progress .
I would like to ask whather you have competitions or different activities ?
they all exploded with loud splashes .
Then , I want to mark , that concert halls were too small , that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts .
Tents remind me of the time when I was in the army - I would prefer log cabin for my stay in the camp .
Then I go to work by motorbike .
Before I used computers generally , It took so much time for me to look up words in a dictionary and looking up for information .
However , there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert .
Thank you for your attenlion and understanding .
Firstly , I 'm very glad to hear from you .
To sum up , there are many disadvantages as well as advantages .
You should avoid the peak times .
And I 'd like to know what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too .
It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays .
For me my opinions on this one is true it is boring , it might be because I am a boy .
Especially I liked that .
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I first bought a computer as I was in university .
They come up with many ideas but it ca n't last for a long time .
Brian learm what happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him .
When I went to buy the ticket , I tried to get a discount with my student card , but that was not posible .
It 's a boring rules .
I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of its creation is great .
In that day i can start my travel ?
The first thing that annoyed me were the forty-five minutes we were waiting for the beginning .
They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often .
The ad also mentioned discounts , but that was n't true either .
On balance , I can affirm that I could n't without this modern technology today .
" Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . " I was reading when I suddenly hard a big bang .
I am writing to you on behalf of my class concerning our trip to London .
Recently , the exhibition of africa just finished .
Madrid is a big city and has many interesting places .
Machines , such as a dish washer , laundry machines and remote controller helps us jut to relax or do a little work is necessary .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Using the equipment and the area that we have to organise some activities .
You advertise the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20 : 15 as it did .
I am good and fast at swimming .
About the activities listed on your letter , I chose basketball and singing .
All these facts mean that our modern life gives big damage to the earth .
Secondly , you have the required information about the end-of-conference party .
For just one day in my summer holidays I planned to do something adventurous .
As well as this , the stars should n't complaint at any time about their fans and their loss of privacy .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you present at the moment : " Over the Rainbow " .
It was supposed to be my perfect everning out . But it was n't .
I really expect that you consider my arguments and cash me back the value of the tickets as soon as possible .
Thank you very much for your letter .
But we should not forget that it 's only tools and emphazise human relationships .
For example , nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show It would be on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00 .
First of all , modern technology has changed my daily life in the last five years more quickly than in the anchient times , or even more than ten years ago .
I find shopping is the most time consuming .
First of all , using a computer is the most important for me because I can store my personal records such as diary or expenses and I send E-mail to my friends who live abroad .
I had to pay the full prize for them , which was quite expencive .
Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love .
One of the most interesting ones is " The old man and the Sea " . A story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught .
Although the show was supposed to start at 19=30 , it started at 20=15 , so I had to wait for an hour .
Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London .
Why did you write that they were available ?
Finally , thank you again for everything and I am looking forward to accompanying you soon .
This again enables people to save time .
I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives however I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or had already fallen in wicked hands .
In my opinion there 's nothing special that I 'd like to change , maybe only this , that I would n't have to change my boots .
I would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize I have won .
Instead , there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and a terribly annoying voices .
I 'd like to know some examples .
I bought a ticket for the 19.30 round and the show was very very late .
You have been presented some reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable .
But in the winter there 's still a problem to solve .
I suppose it will be better for your theatre 's reputation to give at least some of my money back .
I have choosen golf because I have never played this game .
I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurants , but because of the late start of the show , the restaurant was closed by the end of the show .
They are also the lessons which English and other foreigners are particularlly curious in .
I 'm so happy and exciting to receive this letter about I 've won the first prize in your competition .
About the accommodation , I 'd prefer to stay in log cabins , because for me and my family more comfortable .
For works that you needed , for example three hours you can do them in ten minutes ; the same !
It is called Penrhyh Castle , as the building will tell you all about Wales .
My family decided to visit my grandmother in Orlando , because she got some problems with the swiming-pool , she asked my parents to help her in a new swiming pool building .
I also helped in the lighting and studio equipment .
I 'm a fan of Danny Brook so when I read in the advertisement his name I immediately decided to go to the show .
My professor said ' go and get familier with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail .
As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I like it and get quite good marks for my project , about light and sound .
He was very kind to me , we talked about many things and after the concert , he invited all the team to have a dinner , yes I know what you 're thinking , " Dinner and Sting " yes my friend , it was the best thing in my life .
It 's like walking in the clouds you feel like flaing .
Additionally , the advertisement said I can visit the threatre restaurant after the show .
After all this introduction , will be the time to show some of the acitivities every one can participate in the school , such as lesons or others like the library , our protagonist having a cofe with coleagues in cofe bar , the reception service ..
These are my suggestions .
But from the other , everybody has the right to have a secret garden , the right to be with his / her family without being disturbed by journalists and photographers .
According to my job , I had to help the teams with the outlights and of course it had been my first proffesional experience : in the end I felt a member of them , because they were so kind to me , and I could colaborated a lot and I learnt a lot with this project .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisment about fashion and leisure show in London .
The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to have everything in order so the concert could be a succes , which it was .
We shoud n't forget , that for this reason the stars want to keep their private lives away from the media !
I am writing to complaint about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week 's holiday in London .
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has most affected the way of life of people from industrialized countries .
First of all , you 've asked me when I wanted to travel .
There , electric light was invented .
Which clothes should I take ?
The conference party will last at 1.00 AM , but every body does not need to stay until the end .
In addition , I suggest that they should wear sporty and comfortable clothes .
Pat sent to my house a fax with the different alternatives she thought but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the sorprise was ended .
On the other hand , there is a big problem : the mony .
It was so nice to hear from you last time .
In my view , it was extremely interesting and satisfing for me all the concert long .
If you think that fifty years ago , when there were n't cars or any sort of comfort ( born just in the " industrial age " ) everything had to be done by hand or by animal work : I think at that time life was really harder than now !
I was very happy to receive your letter .
After all I am sure that you understood it was n't my perfect evening out and you will give my money back .
During my visit there occurred some problems , that made my evening completely disappointing .
For example , without using internet , I could not put me through to foreign people .
Benoni 's school is a recognised school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels , Belgium .
and the last one . How much money i should take there ?
As I understand it is very imortant to confirm the date of travelling .
I look forward to hearing from you .
BUT WHAT CAN I FORGIVE TO YOUR COMPANY IS TO CHANGE THE START AT THE LAST MOMENT , MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK 'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY dissapointed .
IN MY OPINION , FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS IN SOME CASS , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
I booked Palace Hotel 's restaurant for our party and it is big enough for your students .
Finally , could you let me know what the weather is like in July in States ?
The computer is helpfull when I want to contact somebody very fast .
Therefore , I am interested in staying in a log cabin .
Can I wash any clothes there ?
Painting is something that I love and I am very good doing it .
I used to play Golf for several years and I like to paint the composition .
Please do not hesitate to contact me at ( 0297 ) 8245123 in case of need .
I hope I could give you some ideas .
In my opinion , a guided tour is essential because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions .
The cafe in the hotel are available .
We arrived at the stadium the previous evening .
How has modern technology changed your daily life .
Really he was bad .
Also , I belonged to golf club when I went to university in Japan .
With a computer , however , all this is done in a matter of seconds .
I do n't say anything and let her go on grieving over herself .
However , people noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their minds .
First of all I would like to travel on July because I will I have finished my exams by the end of June .
My daily life is changing .
I suggest a refund of the full price and I hope you are willing to take your responsibilities .
I think that people will be as alone and julous as today .
I 'd like to ask you about how much money I 'll need for two weeks in your country and what sort of clothes I have to bring to Camp California next july .
Finally , I would be grateful to you , if you told me about clothes and money .
There will be music as well for dancing .
Because last time I was in a tent , I find it really uncomfortable and when it rained in the night I could n't get to sleep because of the sound of the water hitting the tent .
In my opinion , the modern technology has changed my daily life is not really a lot because I am just 20 years old and I used to play computer when I was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine .
In addition to this , I wish I am going to sail : I have never tried it , but it seems to be great !
I can send a mail to my friend who lives in Canada .
I 'm an out doors person , who likes to go camping and hiking , so staying in the tents is like a second home to me .
Linking to the internet was so popular .
Last week I recived your letter in wich you told me that I won first prize .
Then the show was suppost to starts at 19.30 hours but it started at 20 : 15 , more than half an hour later .
It also held an internation exhibition all year round .
This show is about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and Hairstyles .
Although it is not very comfortable , I like camping very much .
And finally , your restaurant was not available after the show .
Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their lives have been far easier than before .
For the first activity , I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but I have very little experience in it .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him , in fact , she was so angry she almost kills but she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
I am so excited by the news .
I have recorded a demo tape , which I can send to you if you will , in which I also play guitar .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I was in her room and helping her .
Modern technology has completly changed my daily life , which became more comfortable , and easier .
So , we decide to access our school Main database and change our test results .
For the handicapped , going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothering unless shops have facilities for them .
All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well .
I will ask my money back .
In August , I have to work .
People are used to go shopping because it is easier and familiare , it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner , watch some movies after that , and if you want to buy something at the shops .
Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket , which cost me £20 .
And we have two choices to get to the conference , a bus or a train .
As I came to London on holidays and purchased " The London City Guide " I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance .
I have to finish my studies .
It was last month that I was selected .
It means Japanese are planning for the future home .
But , definetely they has been a very important invention .
Second , I prefer to stay a log cabin .
Secondly , despite your advertisement of the possibility of discounts , when I showed my student identity card to one of your employes she angrily told me that I had to pay the whole prize .
I would be glad if you consider my suggestions .
I wase n't expecting this prize because it was to good to be true .
It is the first step for a true fraternity .
That exciting stories always describe people in difficult situations is true of Agatha Christie 's " Witness for the prosecution . "
Therefore , I would like to ask you for refunding me my entrance fee , as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement .
We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that , especially because we will have the possibility to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery .
Thank you for your letter .
However , we have to consider about our nature and human-being .
You wrote an advertisment that people from more than 15 deferent countries were going to visit this concert , but there were artists only from 6 countries .
ENGLISH : the classroom is beautifull , and on the same day we do a lot of diferents activities , so it wo n't be bored watching it because we can have a great time there .
I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie to aprove .
Please contact me for more details if necessary .
I am writing to inform you about your question .
Another thing was the starting time , the show started forty five minutes late .
It located in the city and the nearest tube station is Moorgate Station .
This has been scheduled 3 months ago .
Before I go on holiday I use the internet to book or get details from the travel agency , which means I can save my time and physical energy .
I have never done light and sound for the real pop concert before and I think it will be a good experience for me .
I had to help the director writing a script of the concert and design the background of the stage .
You will be able to get there either by bus ( no 150 ) or on foot .
You can enjoy your time to watch a film if you have free time .
From there to the conference you have to take the bus number 50 , that stop near the hotel and arrive in town center .
It was really disappointing !
As I have not been there before , I am rather unsure of what to wear .
Some people will do crazy things in situations like this .
And then , when I arrived at the theatre I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly I do n't .
Then we had an idea !
How has the phone affected my own life ?
My favourite sports are climbing and surfing , I 'm very good at climbing but for surfing I need some practise .
On the last day , we have arranged a small party in the hotel , then we set up a sightseeing Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for the airport .
People buy and buy unnecessary things but when they arrives in their houses , they can see an empty wallet .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need .
When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical thing , you migh as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
It seemed to be the most interesting lesson , because students always make some mistake while they are practising with thier partner , in spite of having told from teacher ten times .
I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theatre .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
People must get some rest often , and as a result they look forward some happiness at the free time such as parties , games , and every one loves to party , it should have been filmed .
That time I met the magic world of computers .
I was able to have some signatures .
I think all of these disappointments are too much for one evening .
I think that my parents let me do what I want , because they trust me .
There will be a bus taking students who do not need to stay at the party until the end .
The main is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world .
Secondly , my choise is the accommodation in tents , I think it could be more interesting , I could enjoy my time with other people playing , eating and talking outside , in my opinion if I choose the log cabins it would be like to be at home .
For example , the advertisement said we could buy tickets with discounts , but when I went to buy it your employees told me there were no discounts available .
I am good at swimming and playing tennis .
I ca n't imagine real holidays without a tent .
Some of them are natural whereas others are not .
Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one can imagine life without it .
Journalists should not follow them all the time , trying to make an interview or taking an ' interesting ' picture .
But Ivan was so kind person that he let Gold Fish went without any conditions .
So the rules are clear , you need to participate in the lessons and also be successful in the exam of June 2000 .
We also would like to have a history .
We did not have " a perfect evening " as it was written , we actually had an evening full of the theatre 's mistakes and were extremely disappointed .
I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time .
We had to order taxis for them as they do n't have mobile telephones .
The date is Tuesday March 14 .
I 'd love to hear all your news , why do n't you come and visit me ?
But , it 's not easy for workers , because the shops close their doors about 5.30 pm ( half past five ) .
The party will be taking place in Palace Hotel . The Hotel is very close to Town Hall .
I would prefer in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me .
Being a security guard was the hardest task .
They had invited us and we wanted them to see us stunningly beautiful .
So I am going to ask for a refund ...
This made my life easier , and at the same time saving some trees in a rainforest from being cut .
They nead to be with their family in silence .
Do you think travel chaque would be more secure ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you very , very soon .
I have a baby and three dogs , so it should be better in log cabins .
I would like to know about how many peopl will stay with me into the tent , and take with me special clothes for doing serf .
Of course , our lives will be completely changed .
As you know I 'm in Ferndown now spending last minute studying for exams .
I 'm rather trained in climbing , I have done it once a mounth since I was 17 .
Well that 's all for now and I hope to hear from you soon .
I do n't now when I and going to be free , for going to my planet .
AT seven o'clock on the dot we went there for starting queueing .
Seeing that this is the first year of the drama lessons , it is not very well known .
I am writing to you inconnection with your programme of spending three days in London .
we do n't think that there is less of a hundred years , none of that existed .
As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us .
All syntetic material will be uncomfortable for these people .
I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
In our class , we do n't have a problem with students who dislike to work , because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say there years and years .
There are many interesting works of art by famous painters of this country .
The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm .
I never stayed in tents in the middle of nowhere , in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new .
Then I was 15 years old .
Conclusion : I gave you a lot of reasons to get in this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip in my town .
It already started and do n't have limites to go .
What 's amazing is that ?
Earlier that day , I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones , like the promotion paper said they made discounts to people that worked at the British Institute .
It will be at Central Exhibition Hall , London .
Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for some working inside .
First of all , the name of the hotel which we have been booked into is Palace Hotel .
I hope you are well .
b ) basketball and football games .
I really look forward to it because I have never been to the U.S.A. before .
I look forward to hearing from you .
I have been asked for information on an interesting buildings to visit .
If you give the money back , I will go to the newspaper .
May be there are some occasions which I have to pay myself .
I know that my girlfriend told you that I was helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much .
I hope you can imagine my great disappointment .
You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes , but in my opinion you can wear very cassual .
Firstly , people are able to talk to someone on every time . Be it : just for fun and also to discuss some important and relevant thins .
I believe that everyone in this world have curiosity .
It was said that stars and artists from around the world on the advertisement , but in fact they are from only six different countries , so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year .
I suggest to organize next IAF in the summer .
In addition to these , I can contact to anyone who wanted to talk at any convenient time in case I need him or her , or I am needed .
I am glad to replay your latter .
It is also free to enter for students .
FIRST AND FOREMOST , IT 'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST WAYS OF transport .
In Conclusion I 'd like to recoment that you should , firstly , know what you have to offer and the advertising .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Lots of information in your advertisement are not correct .
Secondly , I would rather be accomodationed in log cabins than go in tens .
I like to go very often , to look around and to buy some new clothes . As long as I am not searching for something specific .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Firstly , you have said in your advertisement that artists from around the world will perform .
I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school , but I do n't have enough power .
Of course they were punished .
With reference to the last afternoon , if I were you I would visit the City Museum .
That was the most scarely and daring thing that I did in my childhood .
I had to wait for forty five minutes .
But what is it , when you ca n't go to a restaurant being afraid of , the journalists , will be waiting outside for you ?
Moreover , it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written on it .
In these days , many kinds of pollution has been caused by our modern life . Air pollution by cars , Soil pollution by industrial wastes .
We have to say that technological searches have taken in our society " good fruit " but , at the same time , negative aspects too .
It is a right like everybody from us has .
Maths is the most popular subject in the school .
For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy , we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATER AND WITH ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE ENTRY .
YOUR ORGANISATION WAS A GREAT DISASTER .
I am writing you to show my disagree about the musical show " Over the rainbow .
I went to Hampton Court last year , and I think it is a great place to visit .
Last week some students of our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March .
Take the 67 route and it will take you just in front of The Royal Hall .
I am looking forward to answer !
There will be a mixture of styles from different times in the past , so if you feel like a medieval princess , you can dress like one .
However , they were very nice people .
To sum up , I enjoy wasting money and buying useful things or not .
The concert was absolutely marvellous !
We do n't have to learn their every second .
The conference is organised in the civic hall so it is very simple to find it .
Unfortunalety my feelings are rather bad .
Most students who were interviewed suggested to have a speaking part of the lesson to be on film .
Other members of groups can wear a normal pretty formal dress .
They are very nice people even Audrey who seems very stupid .
In Conclusion , shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy .
My mother tried to get a doctor , but they said there was no one .
Foremost , after finishing my work , I could meet singers by chance !!
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the programme that you provided .
Finally , I wanted to know if I need money and how many , and if there is a dry cleaning .
If I had a choice , I would prefer to live in a tent then in a log cabin .
The building is huge with high technology and construction and a tight security .
If I 'm not lucky enough to find one , then I 'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping places such as London .
Everything has been finally planed two days before the concert .
As a part of this , the leader of each group has to wear a costume of her country .
I 'm very surprised about the good news and I 'm sure I 'll really have a good time in California .
The show 's date is very convenient - March 14 - , and it is on the Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there .
I 'm writting you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play on your theatre .
It was so fun that I enjoyed it a lot .
First of all I would like to say that I am very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
Particularly , I am pleased to have know the most popular pop stars in the world .
Also Iternet has influence on my daily life , beause I can find there many interesting things , or I can meet with people from all over the world , which is exciting for me .
Secondly , the show should began at half past seven . despite these facts the show began at a quarter to eight .
Just looking around , I realize that modern technology has crept into every area of my life .
Your visit to the shop conludes in a long queue to the checkout ( where you can easily spend another 30 minutes ) where they will suck out some money from your account .
Concerning the proposed activities please , accept me for Singing and Painting .
My fellow students and I know that your husband has his birthday on Tuesday the 16th of June and we would like to organise a party for him .
But I would take the opportunity to improve myself .
I do not expect it .
I would be glad to be able to help you .
I hope you will listen to my suggestions .
But have you thought about what kind of clothes we will wear 100 years from now ?
If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet which you are looking at some interesting things .
How did the beast knew his name ?
The case of the Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities .
Three years ago , when I was in Japan , my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time I get back from the school .
IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG !
The things started happening from the first day we arrived .
What is more , some concert halls were too small .
I do not know if it is possible to make any change in this plan but we saw an ad in " Time Out " magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Generally , we are supposed to treat our parents ( as well as the teachers at school ) with respect and not to argue with our brothers and sisters .
In the evening I got a flat tire , and because of this I was late to the show , when I got to my place , it was used ( it costs a lot ) and they took me to the cheapest seats , where I could n't see a thing .
It is worth visiting exhibition and we would like to go there .
On the contrary , it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities .
I am writing to you becaus I was very disappointing with the presentation you have made to attract people to come to your theatre .
I am writting this letter to informe you about the decisions I have made according to your questions .
I am writing this letter to complane about the Circle Theatre .
Owing to increasing demand of light for more activities , the natural sources is not adequate .
I am writting you for complaining about the last saturday evening performance in your theatre .
What changed my life most is portal computers .
Walking on a city street , it 's difficult to find parks or " green " places with trees and clean air : actually , pollution , traffic and noize are the main problems of our society .
I read your advertisement . However , it was different from the fact .
It seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking though the river .
They just look funny !
And what about mobile telephones ?
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautifull country .
FIRSTLY , I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE BROCHURE .
I have no idea from where to start .
Another actor took his place .
So , you can help them and earn quiete enough .
Swimming is quite nice activity to relax and work out .
First of all , I would like to say that the only month available from me to travel is July .
And then , you may save money for the things you like , nothing to do , just for the poor things what you like so funny is n't it ?
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
Firstly , I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events .
Anyway , as students we do n't have much money to spend on shopping and the good thing is that it wo n't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students .
Another important lesson to film is " culture and civilization , therefore people will know that the hostessess prepered at this school are not only , as the French say , " pot-au-fleurs " , beautiful faces to show off but also well read people .
And we like that , because it 's easier for nothing doing than engaging ourselves in something that makes us do something .
Then we can just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored ready to eat . If we then want to go to work , we do n't have to get our horse , no , we get the car keys and go where ever we want to .
When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I am playing at least at the weekend .
When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty .
In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private lives of famous people .
And please tell me how much money I am supposed to need excluding transport and accomodation .
That made me so disappointed .
But , instead there was a different actor , who I never heard about before !
Secondly , in the article the times were 14 : 30 and 19 : 30 .
I think it would be better for me to travel in July .
The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit in your theatre where I wanted to see the musical ' over the rainbow ' , after I read the advertisement for the show .
I extremely liked all concerts , shows , exhibitions , but why there were n't any photograph exhibitions ?
It started at 20 : 15 and waisted my time and made me feel bad about your service .
Firstly , I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival , it is very interesting , especially for the young people .
My name is Bao-yu Liao .
And we should keep our attention paid in order to save our precious earth .
Firstly , I am a fan of Danny Brook so your advert attracted me but when I went there a different actor was in the musical show instead of him .
I am writing on behalf of the students in my class , thank you very much for the trip to London .
I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall .
That 's why Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
In my daily life , I use the facilities of modern technology very often and it really makes my life easier to live .
I was pleasantly surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition .
But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all over the world and I saw only six nationalities .
One day Ivan caught a fish .
And last , but not least is the fact that famous people ca n't express their emotions , show their real feelings to the public .
The developpement of portable communication systems , such as mobile phones has greatly changed our way of life .
Moreover , we always can call for help to the police , the hospital or to a doctor .
But I do n't think these clothes are going to be a fashion on the earth .
I can take advantage of those technologies as mobile phones , lap top computers , television , to have contact with different cultures .
I cuold read in the advertisment that there were some discounts available but there werent .
My name is ... and I am a student representative .
Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not everyday .
On the last day we are going to have about three hours of free time .
This was my secret and now it was not .
We were really pleased because it was our first time in England .
This will make the festival better . I hope we will meet next year in the festival .
Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on that , however I hope that I can learn about it on the Camp .
It 's quite dificult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot wich are climbing , tennis , surfing and photography , but if I have to make a choise , I choose climbing and surfing .
They are too small for all the people .
First of all , the actor was not Danny Brook .
It will be fantastic !
I 'm looking forward to seeing you on the conference .
I have played basketball for six years , and I 've in competitions for five years .
I think it would be fun to stay in a tent those two weeks , I have never done that before , by my friends told me that I would enjoy it .
The evening that I spent there was terrible so please may I have my money back .
If we do n't want to be in the newspapers , we do n't do politics or movies !
Secondly , when the show started , I was looking for Danny Brook , because this actor was the most important reason for me to come here .
Since secondary school , I am very interested in taking pictures and I have a big experience in it .
It can be very enjoyable .
We ca n't do anything about .
In 100 years , most of the clothes are made from syntetical material .
If you do not return my money I will send a letter to a lawyer .
First of all , I was looking forward to see one of my favourite actors , Danny Brook , and it was very disappointing for me to see a diferent actor instead of him in spite of his name was writen in the advertisement .
I 'm also including the show 's leaflet on the back of this letter .
Now I hope that you can understand my question for some money back because of the trouble I had .
While there I saw your advertisement for the show " Over the rainbow " and decided to go .
Internet was something amazing for me .
Log cabins may be more confortable , on the other hand , I think that I will be able to " survive " in tents .
Can you imagine how exsiting when we stay in the dark and very quite and we can hear the sound of animals .
The majorite has chosen History , which means a big journey around the world , either at the Roman life style , or in the midle age , when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands .
After the concert , many people lost their way home , mostly foreigners who do n't know the buses ' schedules .
It takes place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London .
I 'm writing to tell you about my experience last month .
Lots of People wher injured and even more where suspended the next day at school , when the Headmaster found out what had happened .
However , something came up again .
That fact should be respected by the journalists .
People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary , feel comfortable and stand out .
I would rather choose July because it is only one month when I have got holiday , long enough to spend it by travelling abroad .
My wife an I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago .
These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books .
In your letter you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in tents or log cabin , and I would like to sleep in a log cabin please .
The discounts were n't available and your theatre restaurant was n't open , because the owners were for holidays .
The festival was generally good but I have some suggestions for next year 's festival .
To begin with , we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians , although they sometimes are n't truly .
The company I work , works for Los Svaves , it 's a very famous group from my country .
So I must insist that I want to have a full refund .
I went to London last week for business and loving very much theatre I had promised my friend to offer her , after work , a very good evening with your musical show : " Over the Rainbow " .
To sum up , technology has been a great help to all of us .
I worked all day , but I did it with pleasure .
By the time it finished , I was exhausted , but I certainly enjoyed this experience as you can meet many people at a time and what I liked most was that you can see famous stars very close and listen to their live music for free !
I am a student of a technical univercity .
The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad .
One more thing about the show is , it 's free for students .
Sometimes , when you are shopping on the street , you will see a lot of things that you like , and you ca n't buy it once , you will feel very sad , maybe .
After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce each other .
I think that is a good question to think about .
Please write me a letter as soon as possible !
We will be unwilling to give a housework away .
The sea is polluted by oil and chemical detergent which is used at home .
You are asking me to choose just two activities .
I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us ? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example .
They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready .
My marks was n't good enought to obtain my degree in Computer Science , and the exam session was finished .
During the concert , I do n't have a lot to do , so I had a chance to see most of the performance , that was excellent .
I could then feel her , upset as ever .
I use my computer for collecting reports from the internet and I can promise I found so much information that I could n't analize it in two weeks .
As a result , it was impossible for al the audience to fit in there .
What is it like in July over there ?
But the worst thing comes at the end .
First of all , as you also know , lots of technology has boosted since few years .
This is a very central hotel located not far away from the conference hall .
The boy could not beleive what he was hearing .
You can see the sign of hotel .
I would be greatful if you could arrange these shows in your programme .
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A COMPLETE REFOUND .
Science and technology characterize our moder society .
Having money and being able to spend it on anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it into an enjoyable moment .
The main character of the musical show , which I 'd like to say was n't the " BEST " was awfull .
I holp you 've enjoed my experience , and I hope to hear from you soon .
The sommers and winters get warmer .
Maybe in 500 years , some people will live on Mars and then , they have to wear other kinds of clothes .
We will make him pay .
Do I have to bring some cash on me ?
There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective and he finally solves the mistery . But I will not tell you more .
Secondly , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it .
At First , when Santos Dummont invented the airplane , he probably did not think of how people could transform his creation .
I heard them talking behind the stage .
It is also a suitable present for your cousin , I think .
It caused me missed the train and I went back to the hotel nearly in the mid-night .
It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking , computers , make up , languages , geographie to culture and civilization .
I FEEL YOU LIE ME AND YOUR COMPANY IS NOT SERIOUS .
I mentioned it , but they told me that the promotion had ended a long time ago .
The story describes his feelings , thoughts , fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish .
I look forward to receiving your cheque as soon as possible .
I 'm glad to receive your letter .
I 'll look forward to hearing answers from you .
I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the shows at your theatre .
I do n't like to tidy up , you know !!
Another solution could be to work as a barman , the problem is that you go to bed very late , but it 's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night .
I would like to suggest a change in the programme by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Firstly , we were asked to clear the stadium , especially the seats and surroundings .
In addition to this , doing internet is quite useful and helpful to have information from all over the world .
We want to know what we will have to wear next year but we want to know it now .
Every woman in the world likes the word shopping .
There we can see everything about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
I remember when I was in secondary school . At that time , my friends and I was so daring and full of energy .
However , secondly , famous people are not " ailen " so that they might do something , for example , ashame things in public spaces or arguments with partner or family even put on swimming costume like us .
So we will have free time on the afternoon of the 14th March and we can spend this time to enjoy the show .
How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours , shapes , patterns , and uses ?
Second , I would rather stay in a log cabin , because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places , so a tent would be unapropriate for me .
In the early days , on a raining day you could n't play because most of the game were outside the house but now with the technology you can make many things in your house .
If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers tell me , I 'm in !!!
Thank you very much for your letter regarding my prize that I won in your competition .
I 'm not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to suggest to include this point in the programme .
I 'm pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference .
I felt a lack of them .
Once students have taken a shower after a hard physical training they come to real life , depending on their levels , they have to study for instance languages wich I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because these enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way , students have to manage to speak at least three languages .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
I know I 'm " daughter of this techological world " and unluckly I think I could 'n stay without it : it 's rather strange that today there is already somebody without phones , dishwasher , tv ...
This interactive way of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions .
The show was supposed to have started at 19 : 30 , but it only started at 20 : 15 , so the public , including me , was forced to wait for fourty five minutes .
I would n't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me .
it will be on the 14th and we all want to go .
Second thing , you should open the show on time because if the audience have to wait , they will not feel happy but I think you know that .
The clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart , not how you are going to casino for example but nice casual , not with sports shoes or T-shirts .
It will let me get up and close with nature , and experience life in the wild .
At last , would you tell us which is the best present for him a compact disk or a book .
First of all , the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel , which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities .
I would like to travel only in July because my boss can not give me a leaving for the other months of Summer .
I 'm writeng with reference to your letter .
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accomodation because I have had all holidays with my parents in luxury hotels .
First of all in the description of the show , the starring sould be Mr. DANNY BROOK , and it was n't .
The time had come the who groups had comdined their forces and where ready to strike .
This is a revolution which has changed our daily lives .
And I would like to choose my activities Golf and painting .
I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition .
I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air .
But I would like to suggest some requests for the festival .
The team of volunteers was a great one , and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed .
I am writing to share with you some feelings I have after watching a musical show , which was played at The Circle Theatre last week .
We are all very happy with your programme , especially we like the idea of sightseeing by our and National Art Gallery .
I have n't heard from you for a long time , how are you ?
Another significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances .
Going for shopping is a good thing when you do n't know what to do , but it also has many disavantages .
The last thing is the theatre restaurant was closed after the show , because it only opened until 9 o'clock at night .
In my opinion , we can have a great time there , and entrence is free of charge for students , which is very important as well .
Another disappointing thing was that that discounts were not available , which made me a bit angry .
Singing is the most favarite hobby for us .
I can send e-mails or use the mobile phone .
I think that all these problems could have been avoided and that asking my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening .
I look to hearing from you soon .
In my point of view the hall of the rock concets was too small , you 've to consider making a big one for the next year because of these kinds of events are concurred by a lot of young people .
I 've never been to the USA before .
At that time he was unconcious , I kept asking myself " should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first aid skills to deal with him .
The evening was a disaster and I wonder if I have the right to ask you for returning my money , as I think it is fair .
I 'm asking you my money back , you can do it , ca n't you ?
At the end of the exam session , all students and teachers meet together for a big party to celebrate it .
That was a bit boring , but it was part of my job .
I 'd like to play gold and tennis , I practis both since I was young , and I like them , but I do n't have enough time to play , and my level is n't as good as I 'll like .
It did not go on as I had expected and I was really let down when it finished .
So please , it would be fair that you give my money back .
It is a revolution in the fashion that is starting now .
It started from getting up in the morning , we have the machines help us to cook , iron , cleanning , washing , and then we went out to work , there are cars , sky train to travel for help us convenient and quickly .
I do n't play tennis before , so I am not good .

Can we get there by public transport ?
Concerning the information you want , I will give them .
Today a recived your letter , it is the most wonderful news I here in a long time .
I had to take care of that every artist went in the right dressing room and not someone elses .
Carrying big speakers place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laugh .
First of all , I would like to say that it was the worst performance I have ever seen and it disappointed me very much .
I 've been very thrilled when I 've known , I won first prize in your competition .
According to your letter , I have two options of accommodation , or in tents or log cabins .
Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for good programme which provides us 3 days stay in London .
I 'm writing to complain about the show , that I have recently attended to at your theatre .
Endless imagination and development of technology will lead us to future fashion .
It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and everywhen , even if we are two thousand kilometers away from each other .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions , new hairstyles , new leisure and sports clothing and people teaching how to make up .
Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects .
Please , send me any information of what should I take with me .
They signed my diary and took a photo with me .
This report provides information about Kyong Bok Palace , which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries .
During my prior holiday in London I came across an encourageing advertisment for the show and decided to see it .
I 'm writing to you to complain about three days programme .
I have heard from you recently and I 'm really happy , I hope you and your family are well .
But if you do n't like children and are not easy-going enough to work as a waiter you may choose a more pieceful job of a typist at home .
Are some parties organized during the holidays ?
I was very disappointed with the performance and apart from that there were many problems .
We can watch this problem from two different points of view .
I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition .
Since then I live in Area 57 , and this is my diary life .
She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree .
I know you want to learn what I do and how I helped people at the pop concert last month .
Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands .
It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment .
I would like to see the change in an advantage and a disadvantage , In an advantage . Modern technology is developing toward convenience for humans .
I wonder if I can take them as well .
New fabrics to create new textures , all kinds of accesories are added to create new versions , to refresh old ideas , to make new proposals that will last , like always , just some weeks .
In your advertisement you informed us about their false existence .
I look forward to hearing from you .
There are more and more retailors are opening to customers .
When we finished clearing , some of us offered our help to enter the sound equipment into the stadium .
After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but ca n't find their seat .
I had to bring them refreshments .
I remember when I had the fare lesson in the Univerty and ticher took to the Computer Center an I sow these machins all my College an my were lofing was very dificul Imagent how you Can work in these Kan of Computers .
After a break , the bank has to carry on the concert for another hour and a half .
Secondly , I would like to tell more about end-of-conference party .
Maybe I will tell you in the next letter !
In my opinion , doing shopping brings me a lot of satisfaction , especially when I am depressed , nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
AS YOU CAN SEE , IT Was n't a &QUOT; PERFECT evening " .
In Japan , I often play Golf but as you know Japanese weather condition is not enough to enjoy playing Golf but California has good weather which are every day sunshuin , hopefuly .
in what condition it will be spent ?
I had absolutely no choice .
We have to remember that they need a private life like us .
To begin with , it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in the house .
I think it is also important to present a comercial english lesson , maybe the students could write " offers and orders " or enquiries on the blackboard .
Unfourtunately it is not so cheap .
MY ADRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE .
SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS , MY QUALIFICATIONS WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD .
The location of the party is n't fixed yet , but we will let you know after your arrival .
This is why poor Rod died .
It looked like a floating potato , brown potato .
Will I be going out much , or just stay in Camp California all the time ?
Shops are not for spending our lives in them .
I am writing to reply to your letter saying that I have won the competition , which I ca n't believe it .
I am happy to write a letter to you .
I was n't sure of what to do , and the pressure of everyone watching me , was driving me mad .
At the end of the conference we are having a party with some cold and some drinks .
In conclusion , in my opinion , there are many advantages in my daily life at present and I would recommend people learn computers and would like to say " Enjoy your lives " .
I still go to school and I have plans to go to a college on next year .
Besides , she told me that you are very keen to know how was my experience , so I 'll give you some information in this letter that I 'm sure you will be glad , even if you have not been in the concert .
I think the media must be more understanding .
This lesson will give us to be relaxed and have a laugh .
they know that if I go out with the car , I will not drink .
Obviously Ted should have known nothing about it and remembered it to Pat twice : " the party was a secret ! " " and she said " " yes , it must be a surprise " "
Thank you very much for granting me the first prize - Camping in California .
It started fourty five minutes later .
I was struggling because I knew that if I did not help him , he would die in a short time .
I am writing to reply your questions .
So , I look forward to hearing from you soon .
It feels much better .
We will see people differently , with more calm , because we have no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else .
I 'm including my ticket and this list of complaints as a reason for returning some money .
Everyone will not walk on roads .
And your last phrasal of the advertisement " Your perfect evening out " ! it was n't at all , like I have explained you above in this letter .
Of if we will go to hear a classic concert near the conference building 's ?
What we are suggesting you is to change the programme on the afternoon of March the 14th .
It is like if they lose their concience while they are shopping .
After the cocktail , the Band " Zero one " is playing their famous songs .
Normally I enjoy very much shopping .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
Changes wo n't stop it 's caming the WAP technology ( you 'll buy a cake in a corner 's machine without any coin , only one call ) , digital TELEVISION , virtual reality and more ...
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit that shopping is not always enjoyable .
From my point of view , modern technology has first permit me to find a job as I work as a computer engineer .
Actually my job was not really stressful , but I have contacts and access to all the famous Pop Stars .
In this world , where nations fight to be the better one could n't be diferent : the airplane became the most important thing in the war .
Finally , I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement says and that we all wished turned out to be a regret for the wasted money .
Nowadays most of the people are atractted by shopping centers , which are not always enjoyable .
I could get her as well simmer for a second or two then she suddenly sarted shouting uncontrollably : " Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat " hurled Olga at me through the phone .
When the show finished I was eniting to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed .
Second , how much money is needed ?
What is more , it was their own choice to become popular and well-known .
It was n't difficult because everybody wanted to go .
I look forward to an answer from you .
I think you should make some next year .
We had walked for three hours ( my mother , my two brothers and I ) through the humid and noisy jungle , looking forward to reach a small but clean house where a nice and friendly family , old friends of us , used to live .
This produced a stunning effect during the concert .
Lastly , what you could possibly do while you will be waiting for three hours , for some people who want to go shopping .
I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes .
I usually stay in a tent while camping . Actually , I do n't like tent so much .
I mean , most of the homes are going to be in a building like a flat .
I 'd like to practice golf and tennis .
So I think that the future home could be considered these points .
I am interst playing tennis very much .
Here in Brazil the rules at school depends on the school .
Thoug , a few of us would like to consider the " London fashion and leisure show " .
I was already happy to help in such a big concert than the Mylene Farmer 's concert .
While we were organizing the concert , she was singing on a stage .
I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls .
A serious theatre ca n't miss such an important thing , the starting-time .
Television has affected " all days life too .
Would $ 200 be enough ?
INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES !
The computer has done easy , a lot of work .
The aim of this report is to summerize the result of the survey , which is about making a short video .
If not , pleas let me know .
I was very dissappointed what else can I write .
So did he finally win or loose ?
In my last letter , I promised to write you about my experience working at pop-concert .
Between the tent and log cabin , I think that I would prefer the tent .
Jane and Brian were very happy .
Or asking you for too much .
Could you believe my luck ?
I fell in love with a beautiful girl " Calen " , she is from Spain and was selling " hot dogs " .
It has been quite a long time since I last wrote to you .
Computers that make some little things for us nowadays , but at the speed at tecnology goes in the next century those clothes will tell our doctors our healt at any moment , any time , any where , people will be able to locate us arround the world .
Secondly , I 'd like to prefer to stay in tents , that would be the first chance for me to sleep on the outskirts of California .
I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring , I booked the ticket imagetly .
Last of all , thanks for your consideration about bringing me a present .
I look forward to hearing from you .
They went into the house through a window .
I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing .
