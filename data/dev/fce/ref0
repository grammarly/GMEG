First of all , there are now many things that most people use at home : a fridge , a cooker , and electricity .
Anna prepared the cake , Peter organized the music , and Heather and I went to buy the present . Pat said , " OK , I 'll phone some of Ted 's friends to invite them . "
I have just received your letter .
There were so many happy people in the crowd that the atmosphere was infectious .
But the shape and the rooms of the buildings will still be the same .
I think first of all , we should film an English lesson where pupils could prepare some group work or information boards .
If you ask me , I prefer my friends to do all my shopping for me , because I 'm aware of long lines to check out , crowds of people , noise ...
I would like to do singing and swimming .
Thank you for your kind letter .
I used to enjoy floating in the water whenever I was on vacation .
Thank you for your letter .
But the party was great , after all .
I would like do climbing and sailing while I 'm at the camp . I can climb very well . I used to climb ten years ago in my country .
It was a real pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy .
I could not call my friends from another city and just say " hello . "
In mine , we did n't have many rules .
It highlights the history and considers the interest of young people and makes a final recommendation .
How have you been ?
At present , for example , a lot of people have a personal computer at home , and a very large part of them also have internet , the new frontier of computer evolution .
Will we need any special clothes , and how much money would you suggest I bring for these two weeks ?
I especially liked that .
It might mean waking up early , but it will be less crowded and more comfortable .
I was disappointed with it .
First of all , because of the variety in the store , you often do n't know what to buy because we do n't have just three or four different sport shoes to choose from . We have twenty or thirty , such as Nike , Adidas , or Fila .
The horrible thing about this is , I 'm in heaven , but with the wrong person , because Pat mixed up the people by their names .
Sometimes I am alone all day , but I have contacts with many people .
There are two Carlas in my class !
This evening , as you can see , proved to be far from perfect .
In response to your question , and if you do n't mind , I would prefer to travel in July because I 've already chosen my vacation , and my boss wo n't give me another one .
It is is quite interesting for me to take a photograph in a place I have never been .
I understood everything he said , and Sting told me that I spoke English very well .
I can find some information at home without going to the library .
I used to play tennis when I was a university student .
I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart .
Firstly , I could only spend two weeks next July because , before and after , I have to work as a waiter here in my town .
I am writing to complain about the musical show , " Over the Rainbow , " and about the service .
I 've had so much work at school recently ( exams ! ) and so many things to do , that I 've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit .
The rules at home are very different .
I look forward to next year 's festival .
I am very angry because I wasted my time , and it was a horrible evening , so I would like you return my money and make notes of all these problems .
Thank you for giving me this great opportunity .
It is not always easy , but there are rules in every home , and you have to respect them .
I must say that was great fun . I had never had this kind of experience before .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I look forward to meeting you at the conference .
Children will still need food their mothers make and love expressed , not by a computer , but by parents themselves .
Thanks to all of them , I can live very comfortably .
There seems to be some organizational problems .
We spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs ; all we have to do is watch .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin because , in my opinion , tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in , and they are n't very cozy .
Another simple example is my mobile telephone . A few years ago , I had to buy a telephone card and then find a phone booth to call my parents and tell them that I would be late for dinner , and other stuff like that .
Computers might know better than humans , but there are many things which they can not replace in our life .
I 'll leave it to you .
But , I think it was for the best ; he was also in love with me .
Can I change money on the campus ?
I am looking to hear the news from your group .
I just send an e-mail , and that is all !
The following year , when the bird returned to his house , he gave him a message .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Another example is the internet .
At home it 's completely different . My mom is quite organized , so she always makes new rules .
There are a lot of people who are not willing to type essays and reports themselves or who just do n't have a computer .
Obviously , Pat first refused but then accepted that she was wrong and apologized to Maria . After that , Pat never again talked about someone without his or her permission .
Third , I chose painting and golf as activities .
I had a very disappointing evening .
Shopping is not always enjoyable due to several factors .
So my art teacher came to me and my best friend , who is really good at art too , and asked whether I was able and willing to help for the concert in two - weeks time in the concert hall .
I got bored .
In the present , technology is a part of life .
After a few minutes , I heard steps near my kitchen window .
How much money should I bring .
Over the next few years , people 's homes will change a lot .
Additionally , I felt very hungry and uncomfortable because your theater restaurant was closed , and you did not give us any reason why .
Activities connected with the social program , such as international evenings , sing along parties , and indoor games .
But when I arrived , it was closed .
After the conference , at about 8 p.m. , there will be a party .
I recommend you listen to it !
Also I enjoy walking and photography .
It was really a wonderful day .
In that moment , Pat wished that she never would have been keen on knowing secrets !
But , this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come alive .
We were thinking of so many other activities to relax and enjoy ourselves rather than sunbathing on the beach .
If you want to learn something about the Olympic Games , it must be the best place for this .
He had a punctured wheel , and he did n't know how to repair it . I changed the wheel , and during this time he was asking me about my hobbies , studies , and everything .
My second was to take the money at the bar and bring them to a little room where I could see the pop star walk in the corridor .
What can I do without my music and my computer ?
The show can be seen between 10 : 00 - 7 : 00 .
You could hire others to do the work .
I am writing to provide information about myself .
But computers have n't affected things only positively , because thanks to computers , there are fewer jobs .
Furthermore , I would like to ask you what kind clothes I need to take and how much money I 'll spend .
Next to the restaurant , there is a disco for people who like dancing .
I saw all the pop bands and singers .
Do you recommend that I take only summer clothes , or some winter clothes as well ?
We are looking forward to hearing from you .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
The advertisement says that the show has many interesting programs , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sportswear , makeup and hairstyles , etc .
It is true that science and technology affect our lives a lot .
I never forget important days . All of this is because I have a databank .
Moreover , I have been thinking about changing the location because , as you probably already know , some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody in .
On the other hand , after shopping you 'll be tired , and maybe you ca n't afford your credit card bill .
It shows a great lack of responsibility for a theater like yours to have a delay like that .
Before the concert actually started , I had to give out lots of leaflets , which had a schedule of the pop bands which were appearing in the concert and some information about their performances and backgrounds .
He accepted and we set him free .
It 's an interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway 's work and what he meant by " grace under pressure . "
Looking at your letter , I can see many options for activities , and I realized that I like most of them .
It is very fantastic , especially the program on March 13th when we are going on a river trip to Greenwich .
It will be at the Casino Hotel , and we do n't need to worry about the best way to get there because all the main routes in Devonport have signs with the correct way to this popular hotel .
Bad Jon understood and spoke immediately with his father , who was the school minister , about the children 's plan .
I think that is everyone 's dream .
I am so pleased that I won this prize that I can not explain how grateful I am .
It was a very pleasant surprise to win a trip to California , and I very much appreciate it .
I was very disappointed .
Modern technology has changed my daily life and I 'll try to explain it .
I finish my classes on the 25th of June , and in August I 'm going with my parents to France .
If we went back to the past , we would feel everything . Everything was so difficult to do , we would have to plan and do everything by ourselves , and waste time .
As all the travel expenses are paid already , I would appreciate it if you could tell me what kind of clothing and also how much pocket money I need .
Famous people also deserve to have a private life .
Thirdly , when I bought the tickets , I asked for discounts and nobody knew anything about them ; so it is false there are discounts available .
We all know what shopping is .
When I did that , I was traveling around Japan .
The next day , I helped build the scenery , and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening .
I am writing to reply to your invitation which I have received as a first prize winner .
Then again , after a few minutes the weather changed , and a strong storm began .
The price of the ticket was another problem .
Ernest Hemingway 's sentences are precise but still very powerful and alive .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable .
I look forward to receiving your letter .
Could you do something about this ?
I will not be able to travel in August because I have found a job for that month .
But the best place , to me , is " La Vaguada , " an entertainment and commercial building .
And , of course , not all shops have good air conditioning .
I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part in Camp California in the USA .
In my opinion , this is still correct .
When I think of " the Home of the Future , " I want to have a home which is built with a new material .
Location : The castle is in the city center near an enormous church .
I advise you to do something like that .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Nowadays motorization is one of the most important inventions .
We have invited the students , the teachers , and the principal of the school , but we would appreciate it if you came .
You can open and close the windows and switch the lights on and off .
Also , I would like to do two activities while I am at the camp which are swimming and photography .
The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college , so the best way to get there is walking .
New technology and science will change fabrics so that they will change color during the day .
I have a friend that knows that I speak English , so she offered me work with an English singer . I said , " Yes , of course . "
Unfortunately , it 's not possible unless you can rest in the morning .
We have n't asked for any special clothes , so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes ; although you can come well-dressed , if you feel better .
After your star 's horrible performance comes the beginning of ours .
I used to write letters , but they take a while to arrive or sometimes disappear , so e-mail is brilliant .
The two activities that I would like to do at the Camp are sailing , which I have never done before , and tennis , which I already play quite well .
I have been a full-time student in the university at home , and their classes all require us to have a personal computer , and to use them at any time .
The first thing I do every day , when I get up , is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffee machine .
Photography is a very interesting activity , and it 's not too hard to do .
The job came unexpectedly because my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event .
There are ways to make it more fun .
It was so great to hear that I had won first prize .
While we were installing the sound system , we were listening to Irish music , and suddenly , we saw U2 , which is my favorite group , going into the stadium . They played music for us .
I did n't tell you , but I helped with a concert just by a chance .
Suddenly Pat cried : " Oh my Lord , Bad Jon has done this .
Part of the show can be filmed .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
They should understand when it is too much , when they are going too far .
It is open from 7 : 30 AM until late at night when the theater closes .
Me and my friends were very excited , not because of the stage decoration , but because of the pop singers and bands that we will be able to see !
You must have a TV because you can listen to what happens in the world , and you can see some places that you have n't been to .
I did make-up for them .
The accommodation at the camp that is most suitable for me is in a log cabin .
At the moment I 've only been to one concert .
I really enjoyed being next to pop stars . I got a lot of autographs . That was the first time I 'd seen someone like Jagger . A lot of well-known pop stars were there .
I had to help back stage .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
It was supposed to start at half past seven , but it started at fifteen past eight .
Can you believe you can have any bit of information you need whenever you want ?
If you have problems , we will attend to them . We hope that 's a good answer .
The fact was that Pat chose to go to the year 2000 , and when he arrived , he told everyone that he was the inventor .
They keep claiming that there 's no such thing as shopping .
But it is also true that I could see stars and artists on stage from only six countries , not from around the world as you announced in your advertisement .
It is possible that only one computer will do all of this , and it will have its own personality , voice , and vision .
Nevertheless , I stayed since I had paid .
All the waiting made me quite hungry , so I was expecting to have good meal at the theater restaurant after the show .
Secondly , the concert halls .
By contrast , in the future , I think we will want to go back to ancient times , to have a natural lifestyle .
This is one other important thing to remember .
On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a family .
We would have a lot of money from the job .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If yes , wait until 2100s !
Try to ask who invented the wheel or the book .
Thank you for organizing the program for our class . I think you must have thought for a long time about how we should study for the three days .
That is exactly what happens to me .
That has been my dream since childhood .
There was no way to finally get the diploma .
You 'll have happy memories and be in a good mood .
It will be a great opportunity for me to see the United States . I am so happy about that ; I ca n't even explain it .
I looked out the window and saw a big strange " thing . "
And of course , I immediately said " Yes " .
I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died in a car crash , which was one of the worst examples .
I know how lucky I am .
Firstly , I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove on the stage .
Speech class should be filmed .
First of all , I do n't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my shopping cart ( which , by the way , has its own idea of where it wants to go ) between other desperate people just to find that perfect tin of beans or toothpaste , especially since it is so hard to find anything in a modern , huge department store which is filled with lots of merchandise .
The concerts are fabulous , but the problem is with the halls .
First of all , I would like to travel in July . My college will finish at the end of June , and I am going to go back to Japan in August .
Today , people do not need to spend much time making food , washing up , or even on turning on and off the lights .
Unfortunately , I am not so good at it .
Now , the only thing I have to do is to go to the computer room and turn on the computer .
Why do you put it in the advertisement then ?
Where is the conference ?
Apart from Banks and important offices . There is also the world stock market exchange , an opera theater , shopping malls , and book and records stores .
It 's normal that when you are a star that everybody wants to know all about you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
This means engineers will find ways to use less petrol for it , so it will be useful in the future .
I was sitting and waiting for forty-five minutes until the play started .
They also think that filming some of the lessons , known as " one-on-one " lessons , will interest people in the school because few English schools have these sort of classes .
Imagine that all the people have masks over their mouths and noses , like we have sunglasses , and all the masks are designer brands , which are made of special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
Thank you very much .
You wrote that it was our perfect evening out , but like I said before , it was n't .
I thought they were robbers .
It is the best way to enjoy shopping .
I love traveling when the weather is warm .
Now my cell phone is in my bag and I bring it everywhere .
We hope to see you at the party and have a wonderful time together .
Is n't that a big opportunity for us ?
They have made much progress in our daily life , and they have become more important to us .
Nevertheless , sometimes communications disturb their lives in a bad way .
I am writing to complain about the musical show " OVER THE RAINBOW , " which I saw in your theater yesterday .
Firstly , I will only be able to travel in July because my classes start the month after .
Concerning swimming , I practice this sport once a week myself ; so I am just an amateur , not a great swimmer !
Then I woke up ; well , I shall never know what happened to the " poor cow " !
From Park Square , just go straight .
Try to give up shopping one day and spend your day with friends playing together .
For instance , you want to buy everything you see , and after , you do n't know how much you have spent .
They are against democracy , I think .
When the whole family got up , I told them the truth , and everyone promised to say nothing .
Even food is polluted .
So , they prefer to leave their sons watching TV .
There seems to be a general opinion that sports , art , and music activities such as tennis , football , orchestra , painting , and photography should be included .
One of the reasons I went to see that particular show was the starring actor announced in the ad , Danny Brooks ; but when the show actually started , with a forty-five minute delay , I realized that Danny Brooks was not in the play .
The actor Danny Brook , who was advertised in the brochure , did not play a part in the show .
My name is Valencia Valdez .
I am writing in order to complain about the show " Over the Rainbow , " which was played in the Circle Theatre because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all .
I looked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine .
You had also mentioned discounts , and there were not any .
He was really kind and friendly , but really what I most enjoyed was when he invited me for a drink that night in the most luxurious pub I have ever been to .
I could n't believe my ears .
But this time it 'll be different , I think .
My life would n't be the same without this progress .
I would like to ask whether you have competitions or different activities ?
They all exploded with loud splashes .
Also , I want to point out that the concert halls were too small , and that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts .
Tents remind me of the time when I was in the army - I would prefer a log cabin for my stay in the camp .
Then I go to work by motorbike .
Before I used computers , it generally took so much time for me to look up words in a dictionary and look up information .
However , there was one thing I really liked .
Thank you for your attention and understanding .
Firstly , I 'm very glad to hear from you .
To sum up , there are many disadvantages as well as advantages .
You should avoid peak times .
And I 'd like to know what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too .
It 's fair to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities .
My opinion on this is right . It is boring . It might be because I am a boy .
I especially liked that time .
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I first bought a computer when I was in university .
They come up with many ideas , but it ca n't last for a long time .
Brian learned what was happened and at first he was angry with Pat , but then he thanked him .
When I went to buy the ticket , I tried to get a discount with my student card , but that was not possible .
It 's a boring rule .
I enjoyed it very much , and I think the idea is great .
On what day can I start my trip ?
The first thing that annoyed me were the forty-five minutes we waited for it to start .
They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often .
The ad also mentioned discounts , but that was n't true either .
Overall , I can affirm that I could n't live without modern technology .
" Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , " I was reading when I suddenly heard a big bang .
I am writing to you on behalf of my class concerning our trip to London .
The exhibit on Africa was recently finished .
Madrid is a big city and has many interesting places .
Machines such as the dishwasher , laundry machine , and remote control help us to relax and do only a little necessary work .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
We 'll be using the equipment and space that we have to organize some activities .
You advertised that the show begins at 07 : 30 , not at 8 : 15 , as it did .
I am good and fast at swimming .
About the activities listed in your letter , I choose basketball and singing .
All these facts mean that our modern life causes big damage to the earth .
Secondly , you have requested information about the end-of-conference party .
For just one day during my summer vacation , I planned to do something adventurous .
Also , stars should n't complain at any time about their fans and their loss of privacy .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you are presenting at the moment : " Over the Rainbow . "
It was supposed to be my perfect evening out but it was n't .
I really hope that you consider my arguments and pay me back the value of the ticket as soon as possible .
Thank you very much for your letter .
But we should not forget that they are only tools , and we should emphasize human relationships .
For example , nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom .
However , we saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show . It will be on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00 .
First of all , modern technology has changed daily life over the last five years more quickly than in ancient times , or even ten years ago .
I find shopping to be the most time-consuming .
First of all , using a computer is so important to me because I store my personal records such as my diary and expenses . I also send e-mail to my friends who live abroad .
I had to pay the full price for them , which was quite expensive .
Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love .
One of the most interesting of these books is It 's the story of an old seaman who leaves his town to prove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught .
Although the show was supposed to start at 19 : 30 , it started at 20 : 15 , so I had to wait for an hour .
The Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping center in South East London .
Why did you write that they were available ?
Finally , thank you again for everything , and I am looking forward to meeting you soon .
This again enables people to save time .
I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives ; however , I dislike the idea that such science might fall , or has already fallen , into wicked hands .
In my opinion , there 's nothing special that I 'd like to change , maybe only that I would n't have to change my boots .
I would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize I have won .
Instead , there was an unknown actor , who performed very badly and had a terribly annoying voice .
I 'd like to hear some examples .
I bought a ticket for the 19 : 30 round , and the show was very , very late .
You have been presented with some of the reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable .
But in the winter there 's still a problem to solve .
I suppose it will be better for your theater 's reputation to give at least some of my money back .
I have chosen golf because I have never played this game .
I really liked the idea of visiting your theatre restaurant , but because of the late start of the show , the restaurant was closed by the end of the show .
They are also the classes that the English and other foreigners are particularly curious about .
I 'm so happy and excited to receive this letter about winning the first prize in your competition .
As for the accommodation , I 'd prefer to stay in log cabins , because for me and my family , it 's more comfortable .
Jobs that took maybe three hours , you can now do in ten minutes .
It is called Penrhyn Castle , and the building will teach you all about Wales .
My family decided to visit my grandmother in Orlando because she has some problems with the swimming pool , so she asked my parents to help her build a new swimming pool .
I also helped with the lighting and studio equipment .
I 'm a fan of Danny Brook , so when I read his name in the advertisement , I immediately decided to go to the show .
My professor said , " Go and get familiar with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail . "
As you know I took art for my GCSE and , fortunately , I like it and got quite good marks for my project about light and sound .
He was very kind to me ; we talked about many things , and after the concert he invited the whole team to dinner . Yes , I know what you 're thinking , " Dinner and Sting . " Yes , my friend , it was the best thing in my life .
It 's like walking on clouds , you feel like flying .
Additionally , the advertisement said I could visit the theater restaurant after the show .
After the introduction , there will be time to show some of the activities everyone can join in at the school , such as lessons or others in the library . Our protagonist will be having a coffee with some colleagues in the coffee bar , in the lobby .
These are my suggestions .
But on the other hand , everybody has the right to have a secret garden , the right to be with his / her family without being disturbed by journalists and photographers .
According to my job description , I had to help the team with the out lights . Of course , it was my first professional experience . At the end , I felt like a part of them because they were so kind to me , and I collaborated and learned a lot from this project .
Recently , some students saw an advertisement for a fashion and leisure show in London .
The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to have everything in order so the concert could be a success , which it was .
We should n't forget that , for this reason , stars want to keep their private life out from the media !
I am writing to complain about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week 's vacation in London .
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries .
First of all , you 've asked me when I want to travel .
Therefore , electric light was invented .
What clothes should I bring ?
The conference party will last until 1.00 AM , but not everybody needs to stay until the end .
Also , I suggest that they wear sporty and comfortable clothes .
Pat sent a fax to my house with different alternatives ; but , unfortunately , my grandmother was there and she saw the paper , so the surprise was ruined .
On the other hand , there is a big problem : money .
It was so nice to hear from you last time .
In my view , the entire concert was extremely interesting and satisfying .
If you think about fifty years ago , when there were n't cars or any sort of comfort ( in the beginning of the industrial age ) , everything had to be done by hand or by animal labor . I think in those days life was much harder than now !
I was very happy to receive your letter .
I am sure that you understand that it was n't a perfect evening out , and you will give me my money back .
During my visit , there were some problems that made my evening completely disappointing .
For example , without using the internet , I could not communicate with foreign people .
Benoni 's School is a recognized school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels , Belgium .
And the last one , how much money should I bring ?
As I understand , it 's very important to confirm the date of travel .
I look forward to hearing from you .
BUT WHAT I CAN NOT FORGIVE YOUR COMPANY FOR IS CHANGING THE START TIME AT THE LAST MOMENT. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTIES OF WORKING IN THE THEATER .
IN MY OPINION , FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT IN SOME CASES COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
I booked the Palace Hotel 's restaurant for the party , and it is big enough for your students .
Finally , could you let me know what the weather is like in July in the States ?
The computer is helpful when I want to contact somebody quickly .
Therefore , I am interested in staying in a log cabin .
Can I wash my clothes there ?
Painting is something that I love , and I am very good at it .
I used to play golf several years ago , and I like to paint composition .
Please do not hesitate to contact me at ( 0297 ) 8245123 in case you need to .
I hope I could give you some ideas .
In my opinion , a guided tour is essential because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art , and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions .
The cafe in the hotel is available .
We arrived at the stadium the previous evening .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Really , he was bad .
Also , I belonged to a golf club when I was in university in Japan .
With a computer , however , all this is done in a matter of seconds .
I did n't say anything and let her go on grieving .
However , people know that what is important is not their clothes but their mind .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because I will have finished my exams by the end of June .
My daily life is changing .
I request a refund of the full price , and I hope you are willing to take responsibility .
I think that people will be as lonely and jealous as they are today .
I 'd like to ask you how much money I 'll need for two weeks in your country and what sort of clothes I should bring to Camp California next July .
Finally , I would be grateful if you told me about clothes and money .
There will be music as well for dancing .
The last time I was in a tent , I found it very uncomfortable and when it rained at night I could n't go to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent .
In my opinion , modern technology has changed my daily life very little , because I am only 20 years old . I played on the computer when I was young and washed my clothes in a washing machine .
In addition to this , I would like to sail . I have never tried it , but it seems to be great !
I can send an e-mail to my friend who lives in Canada .
I 'm a very outdoorsy person who likes to go camping and hiking , so staying in a tent is like a second home to me .
Linking to the internet was so popular .
Last week I received your letter in which you told me that I won first prize .
Then the show was supposed to start at 19 : 30 , but it started at 20 : 15 , more than half an hour later .
It also holds an international exhibit year - round .
This show is about the latest fashions , leisure and sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles .
Although it is not very comfortable , I really like camping .
And finally , your restaurant was not available after the show .
Since the electric stove and microwave oven have been invented , their lives have been far easier .
I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very little experience in it .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . Maria was very disappointed when she realized that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings she had for him . In fact , she was so angry she almost killed him , but she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
I am so excited by the news .
I recorded a demo tape , which I can send to you if you like , in which I also play the guitar .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I was in her room and helping her .
Modern technology has completely changed my daily life , which has become more comfortable , and easier .
So , we decided to access our school 's main database and change our test results .
For the handicapped , going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothersome unless shops have facilities for them .
All the students will be provided with snacks , and we have managed to book a band as well .
I will ask for a refund .
In August I have to work .
People are used to going to the shopping mall because it is easy and familiar . It is one place where you can have lunch or dinner , watch a movie , and if you want , buy something in the shops .
Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket , which cost me £20 .
We have two options for getting to the conference : a bus or a train .
I came to London on vacation and purchased " The London City Guide . " I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance .
I have to finish my studies .
I was selected last month .
This means the Japanese are planning for future homes .
But , definitely , they have been a very important invention .
Second , I prefer to stay in a log cabin .
Secondly , despite your advertisement of the possibility of discounts , when I showed my student identity card to one of your employees , she angrily told me that I had to pay the whole price .
I would be glad if you 'd consider my suggestions .
I was n't expecting this prize because it 's too good to be true .
It is the first step to true fraternity .
That exciting stories always describe people in difficult situations is true of Agatha Christie 's " Witness for the Prosecution . "
Therefore , I would like to ask you to refund my entrance fee , as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement .
We have discussed the program in our class , and the students are very happy , especially because we will have the possibility to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery .
Thank you for your letter .
However , we have to think more about our nature and human beings .
You advertised that artists from more than 15 different countries were going to visit this concert , but there were artists from only 6 countries .
ENGLISH : The classroom is beautiful , and each day we do a lot of different activities , so it wo n't be boring because we can have a great time there .
I am allowed to do what I want as long as I study enough to pass .
Please contact me for more details if necessary .
I am writing to answer your question .
Another thing was the starting time . The show started forty-five minutes late .
It 's located in the city , and the nearest tube station is Moorgate Station .
This was scheduled 3 months ago .
Before I go on vacation , I use the internet to book or get details from a travel agency , which means I save time and energy .
I have never done light and sound for a real pop concert before , and I think it will be a good experience for me .
I had to help the director write a script for the concert and design the stage background .
You will be able to get there either by bus ( No . 150 ) or on foot .
You watch a film if you have free time .
From there to the conference , you have to take the bus number 50 , which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town center .
It was very disappointing !
As I have not been there before , I am rather unsure of what to wear .
Some people will do crazy things in a situation like this .
And , when I arrived at the theatre , I expected to get a discount , but , unfortunately , I did n't .
Then we had an idea !
How has the phone affected my own life ?
My favorite sports are climbing and surfing . I 'm very good at climbing , but I need some practice surfing .
On the last day , we have planned a small party in the hotel , then we are all set up to go sightseeing in the Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for the airport .
People buy and buy unnecessary things , but when they get home , they have an empty wallet .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need .
When you are tired of looking around , you might want to buy drinks or something to eat . If you are fed up with historical things , you might as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
It seems like the most interesting lesson , because students always make mistakes while they are practicing with their partner , in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times .
I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theater .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
People must get rest often , and so they look forward to happiness during free time such as parties and games , and everyone loves to party . It should have been filmed .
That was when I found the magic world of computers .
I was able to get some autographs from them .
I think all of these disappointments are too much for one evening .
I think that my parents let me do what I want because they trust me .
There will be a bus taking students who do not need to stay .
The main threat is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world .
Secondly , my choice is accommodation in tents . I think it could be more interesting , and I could enjoy my time with other people playing , eating , and talking outside . In my opinion , if I choose the log cabins it will be like being at home .
For example , the advertisement said we could buy tickets at a discount , but when I went to buy it , your employees told me there were no discounts available .
I am good at swimming and playing tennis .
I ca n't imagine a real vacation without a tent .
Some of them are natural , whereas others are not .
Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it .
Journalists should not follow them all the time , trying to get an interview or take an ' interesting ' picture .
But Ivan was such a kind person that he let the Gold Fish go without any conditions .
So , the rules are clear : you need to participate in the lessons and also be successful in the exam of June 2000 .
We also would like to create a memory .
We did not have " a perfect evening , " as was written . Actually , we had an evening full of the theater 's mistakes and were extremely disappointed .
I would like to travel in July since I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time .
We had to order taxis for them because they did n't have mobile telephones .
The date is Tuesday , March 14 .
I 'd love to hear all your news . Why do n't you come and visit me ?
But , it 's not easy for workers , because shops close their doors about 5 : 30 pm ( half past five ) .
The party will be take place in Palace Hotel . The hotel is very close to Town Hall .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I think it is more exciting and new for me .
Being a security guard was the hardest task .
They invited us , and we wanted them to see us stunningly beautiful .
Therefore , I am going to ask for a refund .
This makes my life easier and at the same time saves some trees in a rainforest from being cut down .
They need to be with family in silence .
Do you think travel checks would be more secure ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you very , very soon .
I have a baby and three dogs , so we would be better in a log cabin .
I would like to know how many people will stay with me in the tent , and whether I should bring special clothes for surfing .
Of course , our lives have completely changed .
As you know , I 'm in Ferndown now , spending the last minutes studying for exams .
I 'm rather trained in climbing . I have done it once a month since I was 17 .
Well , that 's all for now , and I hope to hear from you soon .
I do n't now when I am going to be free to go to my planet .
At seven o'clock on the dot we were there to start lining up .
Seeing that this is the first year of drama lessons , it is not very well known .
I am writing to you concerning your program for three days in London .
We do n't think that less than a hundred years ago , none of that existed .
As you know , we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us .
All synthetic material will seem uncomfortable to these people .
I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
In our class , we do n't have problems with students who dislike work , because we are all there for the same reasons , and nobody wants to stay there for years and years .
There are many interesting works of art by the famous painters of this country .
The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm .
I 've never stayed in a tent in the middle of nowhere , so I would prefer something more real and new .
I was 15 years old .
In conclusion , I have given you many reasons to go to this building , and I hope you will enjoy your trip to my town .
It has already started and there are no limits .
How amazing is that ?
Earlier that day , I went to buy the tickets and decided to buy the expensive ones , since the advertisement said they gave discounts to people that work at the British Institute .
It will be at Central Exhibition Hall , London .
Also , the Theatre Restaurant was closed for some working inside .
First of all , the name of hotel which we have been booked is Palace Hotel .
I hope you are well .
b ) basketball and football games .
I really look forward to it because I have never been to the U.S.A. before .
I look forward to hearing from you .
I have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit .
If you give no money back , I will go to the newspaper .
Will there be some occasions when I have to pay myself ?
I know my girlfriend told you that I was helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much .
I hope you can imagine my great disappointment .
You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes , but in my opinion , you can wear very casual clothes .
Firstly , people are able to talk anytime , be it just for fun or to discuss some important and relevant thing .
I believe that everyone in this world has curiosity .
It said in the advertisement that stars and artists from around the world would be there , but in fact , they were from only six different countries , so I hope there will be artists from more countries next year .
I suggest we organize the next IAF in the summer .
In addition , I can contact anyone at any time if needed .
I am happy to reply your letter .
It is also free for students to enter .
FIRST AND FOREMOST , IT 'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST MEANS OF TRANSPORT .
In conclusion , I 'd like to recommend that you should first know what you have to offer and then advertise it .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Lots of information in your advertisement is not correct .
Secondly , I would rather be in a log cabin than in a tent .
I like to go very often , to look around and to buy some new clothes , as long as I am not searching for something specific .
I look forward to hearing from you .
First , you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform .
I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school , but I do n't have enough power .
Of course they were punished .
In reference to the last afternoon , if I were you , I would visit the City Museum .
That was the most scary and daring thing that I did in my childhood .
I had to wait for forty-five minutes .
But what kind of life is it when you ca n't even go to a restaurant without being afraid that journalists will be waiting outside for you ?
Moreover , it started at 20 : 15 instead of 19 : 30 , as you had advertised .
In these days , many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern life . Air pollution by cars , soil pollution by industrial wastes .
We have to say that technological advances have brought our society " good fruit , " but at the same time , it has brought negative aspects too .
It is a right that everybody has .
Math is the most popular subject in the school .
For instance , I spent my spring break with friends in Italy . We went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( among other reasons ) .
YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATE AND WITH NO DISCOUNT FOR US ON ADMISSION .
YOUR ORGANIZATION IS A GREAT DISASTER .
I am writing you to show my disappointment about the musical show " Over the Rainbow . "
I went to Hampton Court last year , and I think it is a great place to visit .
Last week , some students in our class saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will be on Tuesday the 14th of March .
Take the 67 route , and it will take you right in front of The Royal Hall .
I am looking forward to your answer !
There will be a mixture of styles from different times of the past , so if you feel like a medieval princess , you can dress like one .
But , they were very nice people .
To sum up , I enjoy spending money and buying useful things .
The concert was absolutely marvelous !
We do n't have to know their every second .
The conference is organized in the civic hall , so it is very simple to find .
Unfortunately , my opinions are rather bad .
Most students who were interviewed suggested filming the speaking part of the lesson .
Other members of the groups can wear a normal , pretty , formal dress .
They are very nice people , even Audrey , who seems very stupid .
In conclusion , shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too busy .
My mother tried to get a doctor , but they said there was none .
Most importantly , after finishing my work , I could meet singers by coincidence !!
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the program that you provided .
Finally , I wanted to know if I need money and how much , and if there is dry cleaning available .
If I had a choice , I would prefer a tent to a log cabin .
The building is huge with high-tech construction and tight security .
If I 'm not lucky enough to find some , then I 'll have to take a train to larger shopping places , such as London .
Everything has finally been planned , two days before the concert .
As a part of this , the leader of each group has to wear a costume from her country .
I 'm very surprised by this good news ; I 'm sure I 'll have a really good time in California .
The show 's date is very convenient : March 14 . It 's in Central Exhibition Hall , so I do not think it would be a problem to get there .
I 'm writing to tell you what a bad experience I had during my vacation when I went to see the play at your theater .
It was so much fun . I enjoyed it a lot .
First of all , I would like to say that I am very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
I am particularly pleased to have met the most popular pop stars in the world .
Also , the Internet has influence on my daily life , because I can find many interesting things or meet with people from all over the world , which is exciting for me .
Secondly , the show should have begun at half past seven . Despite this , the show began at a quarter to eight .
Just looking around , I realized that modern technology has crept into every area of my life .
Your visit to the shop concludes in a long line to the checkout ( where you can easily spend another 30 minutes ) where they will suck some money from your account .
Concerning the proposed activities , please accept me for singing and painting .
My fellow students and I know that your husband has his birthday on Tuesday , the 16th of June , and we would like to organize a party for him .
But I would like the opportunity to improve myself .
I did not expect it .
I would be glad to be able to help you .
I hope you will listen to my suggestions .
But have you thought about what kind of clothes we will wear 100 years from now ?
If you are going shopping , someone can easily steal your wallet while you are looking at something interesting .
How did the beast know his name ?
The case of Princess Diana shows how this problem can reach an extreme .
Three years ago when I was in Japan , my parents were both working ; neither of them were at home when I got back from school .
IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG !
Things started happening from the first day we arrived .
What is more , some concert halls were too small .
I do not know if it is possible to make any changes to this plan , but we saw an ad in " Time Out " magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Generally , we are supposed to treat our parents ( as well as the teachers at school ) with respect and not argue with our brothers and sisters .
In the evening , I got a flat tire . Because of this I got to the show late . When I got to my seat , it was occupied ( it cost a lot ) , and they took me to the cheapest seats , where I could n't see a thing .
It is worth visiting this exhibition , and we would like to go there .
On the other hand , it is far from the city and transportation is difficult .
I am writing to you because I was very disappointed with the presentation you have made to attract people to your theater .
I am writing this letter to inform you about the decisions I have made regarding your questions .
I am writing this letter to complain about the Circle Theatre .
Due to the increasing demand for light for more activities , the natural source is not adequate .
I am writing to you to complain about last Saturday evening 's performance in your theater .
What has changed my life the most is the portable computer .
Walking down a city street , it 's difficult to find parks or " green " places with trees and clean air ; actually , pollution , traffic , and noise are the main problems of our society .
I read your advertisement , which was different from the truth .
It 's seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon , looking at the river .
They just look funny !
And what about mobile telephones ?
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautiful country .
FIRSTLY , I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE BROCHURE .
I have no idea where to start .
Another actor took his place .
So , you can help them and earn quite enough .
Swimming is a nice activity for relaxing and working out .
First of all , I would like to say that the only month I 'm available to travel is July .
And then you save money , just for the little things that you like . It 's so funny , is n't it ?
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
Firstly , I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I had the opportunity to enjoy different arts events .
As students , we do n't have much money to spend on shopping , and the good thing is that it wo n't affect the budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students .
Another important lesson to film is " culture and civilization " so that people will know that the hostesses prepared at this school are n't just , as the French say , " pot-au-fleurs , " beautiful faces to show off , but also well-read people .
And we like that , because it 's easier to do nothing than to engage ourselves in something active .
Next , we can just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored and ready to eat . If we then have to go to work , we do n't have to get our horse ; we get the car keys and go wherever we want .
When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I play at least on weekends .
When the concert started , I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and thirsty .
In my opinion , journalists should have more respect for the private lives of famous people .
And please tell me how much money I need excluding transport and accommodation .
That disappointed me so much .
But , there was a different actor , who I had never heard of before !
Secondly , in the article , the times were 14 : 30 and 19 : 30 .
I think it would be better for me to travel in July .
The only thing which really disappointed me was a visit to your theater , where I wanted to see the musical " Over the Rainbow " after I read the advertisement for the show .
I really liked all the concerts , shows , and exhibitions ; but why were n't there any photography exhibitions ?
It started at 20 : 15 , which wasted my time and made me feel bad about your service .
First of all , I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival ; it is very interesting , especially for young people .
My name is Bao-yu Liao .
And we should keep paying attention in order to save our precious earth .
Firstly , I am a fan of Danny Brook , so your advertisement attracted me ; but when I went , there was a different actor in the musical show .
I am writing on behalf of the students in my class to thank you very much for the trip to London .
I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall .
That 's why Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
In my daily life , I use modern technology very often and it really makes my life easier .
I was pleasantly surprised that I won the first prize in your competition .
Firstly , it is a good idea that the festival is international .
One day Ivan caught a fish .
And , last but not least , is the fact that famous people ca n't express their emotions , nor show their real feelings in public .
The development of portable communication systems , such as mobile phones , has greatly changed our way of life .
Moreover , we can always call the police , the hospital , or a doctor for help .
But , I do n't think these clothes are going to be fashionable on Earth .
I can take advantage of technologies such as mobile phones , laptop computers , and television , and have contact with different cultures .
I could read in the advertisement that there were discounts available , but there were n't .
My name is ... and I am a student representative .
Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable , but not everyday .
On the last day we are going to have about three hours of free time .
This was my secret and now it was not .
We were really pleased because it was our first time in England .
They will make the festival better . I hope we will meet next year at the festival . I hope we will meet next year at the festival .
Climbing is something new for me , and I am not so good at it ; however I hope that I can learn at the camp .
It 's quite difficult , because there are 4 of them I like a lot : climbing , tennis , surfing , and photography . But if I have to make a choice , I choose climbing and surfing .
They are too small for all the people .
First of all , the actor was not Danny Brook .
It will be fantastic !
I 'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
I have played basketball for six years , competitively for five .
I think it would be fun to stay in a tent those two weeks . I have never done that , but my friends told me that I would enjoy it .
The evening that I spent there was terrible , so please may I have my money back ?
If you do n't want to be in the newspapers , do n't do politics or movies !
Secondly , when the show started , I was looking for Danny Brook , because this actor was the most important reason for me to come here .
Since secondary school , I have been very interested in taking pictures , and I have a lot of experience .
It could be very enjoyable .
We ca n't do anything about it .
In 100 years most clothes will be made from synthetic material .
If you do not return my money , I will send a letter to a lawyer .
First of all , I was looking forward to seeing one of my favorite actors , Danny Brook . It was very disappointing for me to see a different actor , in spite of his name being in the advertisement .
I 'm also including the show 's leaflet on the back of this letter .
Now I hope that you can understand my question about some money back because of the trouble I had .
While there , I saw your advertisement for the show " Over the Rainbow " and decided to go .
The internet was something amazing for me .
Log cabins may be more comfortable , but I think that I will be able to " survive " in a tent .
Can you imagine how exciting and quiet it will be when we stay in the dark and we can hear the sounds of animals ?
The majority chose history , which is like a journey around the world , whether through the Roman times , or the Middle Ages , when a revolution happened with deals and new lands .
After the concert , many people got lost on their way home , mostly foreigners who did n't know the bus schedule .
It takes place on Tuesday , March 14 from 10 : 00 to 19 : 00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London .
I 'm writing to tell you about my experience last month .
Lots of people were injured , and even more were suspended the next day at school , when the headmaster found out what had happened .
However , something else happened .
That fact should be respected by journalists .
People spend a lot of money to have something extraordinary , feel comfortable , and stand out .
I would rather choose July because it is the only month when I have enough vacation to travel abroad .
My wife and I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago .
These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books .
In your letter you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in a tent or log cabin , and I would like to sleep in a log cabin , please .
The discounts were n't available and your theater restaurant was n't open , because the owners were on vacation .
The festival was generally good , but I have some suggestions for the next year 's festival .
To begin with , we enjoy reading gossip about famous stars and politicians , although it sometimes is n't true .
The company I work for works for Los Suaves , a very famous group from my country .
So I must insist that I want to have a full refund .
I went to London last week for business and loved your theatre very much . I had promised my friend to show her a very nice evening after work at your musical show : " Over the Rainbow " .
To sum up , technology has been a great help to all of us .
I worked everyday , but I did it with pleasure .
By the time it ended , I was exhausted ; but I certainly enjoyed this experience because you meet so many people at once . What I liked most was that you can see famous stars very close and listen to their live music for free !
I am a student at a technical university .
The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad .
One more thing about the show is it 's free for students .
Sometimes , when you 're shopping on the street , you will see a lot of things that you like , but you ca n't buy at once . Maybe you will feel very sad .
After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a prior snack time in order to introduce ourselves to eachother .
I think that is a good question to think about .
Please write me a letter as soon as possible !
We will be unwilling to do housework .
The sea is also polluted by oil and chemical detergents , which are used at home .
You are asking me to choose just 2 activities .
I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us ? Well , Hemingway is a very good example .
They had water bombs and water pistols ready .
My marks were n't good enough to obtain my degree in Computer Science , and the exam session was finished .
During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had a chance to see most of the performances . That was excellent .
I could feel her , upset as ever .
I used my computer to collect reports from the internet , and I promise , I found so much information that I could n't analyze it in two weeks .
As a result , it was impossible for everyone to fit .
What is it like in July over there ?
But the worst thing comes at the end .
First of all , as you also know , lots of technology has boomed in a few years .
This is a central hotel located not far from the conference hall .
The boy could not believe what he was hearing .
You can see the hotel sign .
I would be grateful if you could add this show to your program .
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A COMPLETE REFUND .
Science and technology characterize modern society .
Having money and being able to spend it on anything you want is brilliant , so you try to turn it into an enjoyable moment .
The main character of the musical , which I must say was n't the " BEST " , was awful .
I hope you 've enjoyed my experience , and I hope to hear from you soon .
Summers and winters will get warmer .
Maybe , in 500 years , people will live on Mars , and they 'll have to wear different kinds of clothes .
We will make him pay .
Do I have to bring some cash with me ?
There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective who finally solves the mystery . But I will not tell you more .
Secondly , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
When Santos Dumont first invented the airplane , he probably did n't think about how people would transform his creation .
I heard them talking behind the stage .
It is also a suitable present for your cousin , I think .
It caused me to miss the train and I got back to the hotel nearly at midnight .
It offers a wide choice of classes from cooking , computers , makeup , languages , and geography to culture and civilization .
I FEEL LIKE YOU LIED TO ME , AND YOUR COMPANY IS NOT SERIOUS .
I mentioned it , but they told me that the promotion had ended a long time ago .
The story describes his feelings , thoughts , fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish .
I look forward to receiving your check as soon as possible .
I 'm glad to receive your letter .
I look forward to hearing answers from you .
I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during shows at your theater .
I do n't like to tidy up , you know !!
Another solution could be working as a barman . The problem is that you go to bed very late , but it 's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night .
I would like to suggest a change in the program by replacing shopping with going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Firstly , we were asked to clear the stadium , especially the seats and surroundings .
In addition to this , using the internet is quite useful ; it 's helpful to have information from all over the world .
We want to know what we will have to wear next year , but we want to know it now .
Every woman in the world likes the word shopping .
There we can see everything about the latest fashions , leisure and sportswear , makeup and hairstyles .
I remember when I was in secondary school , my friends and I were so daring and full of energy .
However , famous people are not " aliens , " so they might do things , for example , shameful things , in public or argue with a partner or family , even put on a swimsuit , like us .
So , we will have free time on the afternoon of the 14th of March to spend enjoying the show .
How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colors , shapes , patterns , and functions ?
Second , I would rather stay in a log cabin because I tend to get very nervous in small , enclosed places , so a tent would be inappropriate for me .
In the early days , on a rainy day , you could n't play because most games were played outside , but now with technology you can do many things inside .
If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers , tell me , and I 'm in !!!
Thank you very much for your letter regarding my prize that I won in your competition .
I 'm not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to suggest including this in the program .
I 'm pleased to be able to help you with the international student conference .
I felt like I needed them .
Once students have taken a shower after hard physical training , they begin real life . Depending on their levels , they have to study languages , which I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because it enables staff to communicate with clients in a proper way . Students have to be able to speak at least three languages .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing , above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work week and are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
I know I 'm a " daughter of this technological world , " and unfortunately , I think I could n't be without it . It 's rather strange that today there 's still anybody without a phone , dishwasher , TV ...
This interactive way of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions .
The show was supposed to have started at 19 : 30 . But it did n't start until 20 : 15 , so the public , including me , was forced to wait for forty - five minutes .
I would n't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me .
It will be on the 14th , and we all want to go .
Second , you should open the show on time because if the audience has to wait , they will not be happy . But I think you know that .
They should wear smart clothes , not as if you are going to a casino , for example , but nice casual , no sports shoes or T-shirts .
It will let me get up close with nature , and experience life in the wild .
Finally , would you tell us which is the better present for him : a compact disk or a book ?
First of all , the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel , which is impressive in terms of comfort and facilities .
I would like to travel in July because my boss can not give me time off during the other months of summer .
I 'm writing in reference to your letter .
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accommodation because I have taken all vacations with my parents in luxury hotels before .
First of all , according to the description of the show , the star would be Mr. DANNY BROOK , and it was n't .
The time had come . The two groups had combined their forces and were ready to strike .
It was a revolution which changed our daily life .
And I would like to choose for my activities golf and painting .
I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition .
I would prefer the tent accommodation at Camp California because it would be nice to spend time living in a nice environment and fresh air .
But I would like to make some requests for the festival .
The team of volunteers was great , and we were all willing to help in anything they needed .
I am writing to share with you some opinions I have after watching a musical show , which was at The Circle Theatre last week .
We are all very happy with your program , especially the idea of sightseeing and the National Art Gallery .
I have n't heard from you for a long time . How are you ?
Another significant technological development is the creation of electrical appliances .
Going shopping is a good thing when you do n't know what to do , but it also has many disadvantages .
The last thing was the theater restaurant was closed after the show , because it was only open until 9 o'clock at night .
In my opinion , we can have a great time there , and admission is free of charge for students , which is very important as well .
Another disappointing thing was that discounts were not available , which made me a bit angry .
Singing is our favorite hobby .
I can send e-mails or use a mobile phone .
I think that all these problems could have been avoided , and that asking for my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
From my point of view , the hall for the rock concerts was too small .
I 've never been to the USA .
At that time , he was unconscious . I kept asking myself , " Should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first-aid skills to deal with him ? "
The evening was a disaster and I wonder if I have the right to ask you for a refund , which I think is fair .
I 'm asking you for my money back . You can do it , ca n't you ?
At the end of the exam session , all students and teachers get together for a big party to celebrate .
That was a bit boring , but it was part of my job .
I 'd like to play golf and tennis . I 've been practicing both since I was young . I like to play , but I do n't have enough time , so my level is n't as good as I 'd like .
It did n't go as I had expected , and I was really let down when it finished .
So please , it would be fair for you to give me my money back .
There is a revolution in fashion that is starting now .
" It starts when you get up in the morning . We have machines that help us to cook , iron , clean , and wash . Then we go to work . There are cars and SkyTrains for convenient and quick travel . "
I have n't played tennis before , so I am not very good .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
As you already know , I am trying to become a professional photographer , so I choose photography as the first activity and painting as the second .
Can we get there by public transport ?
Concerning the information you want , I will give it .
Today I received your letter . It is the most wonderful news I 've had here in a long time .
I had to make sure that every artist went in the right dressing room and not in someone else 's .
Carrying big speakers from place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laughs .
First of all , I would like to say that it was the worst performance I have ever seen , and it disappointed me very much .
I was very thrilled when I found out that I won first prize in your competition .
According to your letter , I have two options for accommodation : in a tent or a log cabin .
Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for a good program which gives us 3 days in London .
I 'm writing to complain about the show that I recently attended at your theater .
Endless imagination and the development of technology will lead us to future fashion .
It is now possible to talk to a friend almost anywhere and anytime , even if we are two thousand kilometers away from each other .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions , new hairstyles , new leisure and sports clothes , and people teaching how to do makeup .
Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets , and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects .
Please send me any information on what should I take with me .
They signed my diary and took a photo with me .
This report provides the information about Kyong Bok Palace , which is highly recommended to visit for people from foreign countries .
During my previous vacation in London , I came across an encouraging advertisement for the show and decided to see it .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the three-day program .
I have heard from you recently , and I 'm really happy . I hope you and your family are well .
But if you do n't like children and are not easygoing enough to work as a waiter , you may chose the more peaceful job of typist from home .
Are some parties organized during the holidays ?
I was very disappointed with the performance , and apart from that , there were many problems .
We can look at this problem from two different points of view .
I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition .
Since then I have lived in Area 57 , and this is my diary .
She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree .
I know you want to learn what I did and how I helped people at the pop concert last month .
Shopping is about people 's exchanging money for needs .
It is certain that the program will give the students considerable enjoyment .
I like to see the changes as having advantages and disadvantages . One advantage is that modern technology is creating convenience for humans .
I wonder if I can bring them as well .
New fabrics create new textures . All kinds of accessories are added to create new versions , refresh old ideas , and come up with new proposals that will last , like always , just a few weeks .
In your advertisement you falsely informed us of their existence .
I look forward to hearing from you .
More and more retailers are opening for customers .
When we finished clearing , some of us offered our help to bring the sound equipment into the stadium .
After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but could n't find their seat .
I had to bring them refreshments .
I remember when I was in the University , the teacher took us to the Computer Center , and I saw these machines ; my whole class and I were laughing . It was very difficult to imagine how you could work on this kind of computer .
After a break , the bench had to be carried to the concert for another hour and a half .
Secondly , I would like to tell you more about end-of-conference party .
Maybe I will tell you in the next letter !
In my opinion , doing shopping brings me a lot of satisfaction especially when I am depressed ; nevertheless , it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
AS YOU CAN SEE , IT WASN'T A " PERFECT EVENING . "
In Japan , I often play golf ; but , as you know , Japanese weather does n't allow for enough golf . In Japan , I often play golf ; but , as you know , Japanese weather does n't allow for enough golf . But California has good weather , every day sunshine , hopefully .
In what conditions will it be spent ?
I had absolutely no choice .
We have to remember that they need a private life , like us .
To begin with , it would be good to look back on how our parents lived at home .
I think it is also important to present a business English lesson ; maybe pupils could write " offers and orders " or inquiries on the blackboard .
Unfortunately , it is not so cheap .
MY ADRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE .
SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS , AND MY QUALIFICATIONS WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD .
The location of the party is n't fixed yet , but we will let you know after your arrival .
This is why poor Rod died .
It looked like a floating brown potato .
Will I be going out much , or just staying in Camp California all the time ?
Shops are not for spending our lives in .
I am writing to reply to your letter saying that I have won the competition , which I ca n't believe .
I am happy to write to you .
I was n't sure what to do , and the pressure of everyone watching me was driving me mad .
At the end of the conference , we are having a party with some cold food and some drinks .
In conclusion , in my opinion , there are many advantages in my daily life . I would recommend people learn to use computers . I would like to say , " Enjoy your lives . "
I still go to school , and I plan to go to college next year .
Also , she told me that you are very keen to know about my experience , so I 'll give you some information in this letter that I 'm sure you will be glad to know , even if you were n't at the concert .
I think the media should be more understanding .
This lesson will allow us to relax and have a laugh .
They know that if I take the car , I will not drink .
Obviously , Ted should have known nothing about it , and we reminded Pat twice , " The party is a secret ! " And she said , " Yes , it must be a surprise ! "
Thank you very much for granting me the first prize - Camping in California .
It started forty - five minutes later .
I was struggling because I knew if I did n't help him , he would die in a short time .
I am writing to reply to your questions .
So I look forward to hearing from you soon .
It feels much better .
We will see people differently , more calmly , because we have no stress , and we are not in a hurry to do something else .
I 'm including my ticket and this list of complaints as the reason for the refund .
People will not walk down roads .
And your last phrase of the advertisement " Your perfect evening out ! " was n't true at all , like I have explained to you above in this letter .
Or , going to hear a classic concert near the conference building ?
What we are suggesting is to change the program on the afternoon of March 14th .
It 's like they lose their mind while they are shopping .
After cocktails , the band " Zero One " will be playing their famous songs .
Normally , I really enjoy a lot of shopping .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
Changes wo n't stop . WAP technology ( you 'll be able to buy a snack from a vending machine without any cash , only one call ) , digital TV , virtual reality , and more are coming .
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable .
From my point of view , modern technology has permitted me to have a career , since I work as a computer engineer .
Actually , my job was not very stressful , but I had contact and access to all the famous pop stars .
In this world , where nations fight to be the best , things could n't be more different : the airplane became the most important thing in the war .
Finally , I just want to say that the perfect evening that was advertised and that we all wished for turned out to be a regrettable waste of money .
Nowadays , most people are attracted by shopping centers , which is not always enjoyable .
I could get her to simmer down for a second or two , and then she would suddenly start shouting uncontrollably . " Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat , " hurled Olga at me through the phone .
When the show finished , I wanted to visit the theater restaurant but it was closed .
Second , how much money do I need ?
It was their own choice to become popular and well-known .
That was n't difficult because everybody wanted to go .
I look forward to an answer from you .
I think you should have some next year .
We had walked for three hours ( my mother , my two brothers , and I ) through the humid and noisy jungle . We were looking forward to reaching a small , but clean house where a nice and friendly family , old friends of ours , used to live .
This produced a stunning effect during the concert .
Lastly , what could you possibly do while waiting for three hours for some people who want to go shopping .
I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes .
I usually stay in a tent while camping , but I do n't actually like tents that much .
I mean , most homes are going to be in a building , like a flat .
I 'd like to practice golf and tennis .
So I think that the future of homes should consider these points .
I am very interested in playing tennis .
Here in Brazil , the rules at school depend on the school .
However , a few of us would like to consider the " London Fashion and Leisure Show . "
I was already happy to help at such a big concert as Mylene Farmer .
While we were organizing the concert , she was singing on stage .
I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls .
A serious theatre ca n't mess up such an important thing as the starting time .
Television has affected daily life , too .
Would $ 200 be enough ?
INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES !
The computer has made a lot of jobs easier .
The aim of this report is to summarize the result of the survey , which is about making a short video .
If not , please let me know .
I was very disappointed . What else can I say ?
So did he finally win or loose ?
In my last letter , I promised to write to you about my experience working at a pop concert .
Between the tent and the log cabin , I think that I would prefer the tent .
Jane and Brian were very happy .
or asking you for too much .
Can you believe my luck ?
I fell in love with a beautiful girl , Calen . She is from Spain and was selling hot dogs .
It has been quite a long time since I last wrote to you .
Computers do some things for us nowadays ; but at the speed that technology moves , by the next century our clothes will be able to tell our doctors about our health at any moment , any time , anywhere . People will be able to locate us anywhere in the world .
Secondly , I 'd like to stay in a tent . This will be the first chance for me to sleep in the California outdoors .
I like Danny Brook as an actor , and when I read that he would be starring , I booked the ticket immediately .
Last of all , thanks for your consideration in bringing me a present .
I look forward to hearing from you .
They went into the house through a window .
I think the students will enjoy this tour .
