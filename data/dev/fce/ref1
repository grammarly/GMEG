First , there are now a lot of things that most people use at home , for example : a fridge , an oven , or just electricity .
Anna prepared the cake , Peter organized the music , and Heather and I went to buy the present . Pat said , " OK , I 'll phone some of Ted 's friends to invite them . "
I have just received your letter .
There were so many happy people in the crowds that the atmosphere was infectious .
But the shape and rooms of a building will still be the same .
I think , first of all , we should film an English lesson , where pupils could prepare some group work or some information boards .
If you ask me , I prefer my friends to do all the shopping for me because of the long lines at the checkout , the crowds of people , the noise ...
I would like to do singing and swimming .
Thanks a lot for your kind letter .
I used to enjoy floating in the water whenever I was on vacation .
Thank you for your letter .
But in spite of that , the party was great .
I would like to do climbing and sailing while I 'm at the camp . I can climb very well ; I used to climb ten years ago in my country .
It was really a pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy .
I could not call my friends in another city and just say " hello . "
In mine , we did n't have many rules .
It highlights the background history and considers the interests of young people , and makes a final recommendation .
How have you been ?
These days , for example , a lot of people have a personal computer at home , and a very big portion of them also have internet , the new frontier of computer evolution .
Will we need any special clothes , and how much money would you suggest I carry for these two weeks ?
I liked that especially .
It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip .
I was disappointed with it .
First of all , because of the large variety in the store , very often you do n't know what to buy because you do n't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from ; no , you have to choose out of twenty or thirty , such as Nike , Adidas , or Fila .
The horrible thing about this is I 'm still in heaven , but with the wrong person , because Pat mixed up their names .
Sometimes I stay alone all day but I have contact with many people .
There are two Carlas in my class !
This evening , as you can see , proved to be far from perfect .
In response to your question , and if you do n't mind , I would prefer to travel in July because I 've already chosen my vacation , and my boss wo n't give me another one .
It is quite interesting for me to do photography , taking photographs in a place I 've never been before .
I understood everything he said , and Sting told me that I speak English very well .
I can find information at home , without going to the library .
I used to play tennis when I was a university student .
I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart .
Firstly , I could go for these two weeks during next July only , because before and after , I have to work as a waiter here in my town .
I am writing to complain about the musical show , " OVER THE RAINBOW " , and also about the service .
I 've had so much work at school recently ( exams ! ) and so many things to do , that I 've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit .
The rules at home are very different .
I look forward to next year 's festival .
I am very indignant because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening , so I would like you return my money and make note of all these problems .
Thank you for giving me this great opportunity .
It is not always easy , but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them .
I must say that it was great fun ; I 've never had this kind of experience before .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I look forward to meeting you at the conference .
In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer , but by parents themselves .
Owing to all of them , I can live very comfortably .
Some problems of organization seem to be appearing .
We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with programs , and all we have to do is watch .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion , tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in and they are n't very cozy .
Another simple example is my mobile phone ; a few years ago , I had to buy a phone card and then find a telephone booth to call my parents and tell them that I would be late for dinner , and other stuff like that .
Computers might know more than humans , but there are many things which they can not replace in our lives .
I 'll leave it to you .
But then again , I think it was for the best : he was also in love with me .
Can I change money on the campus ?
I am looking forward to hearing the news from your group .
I just send an e-mail and that 's it !
The following year , when the bird returned his house , he gave him a message .
I am looking to hear from you .
Another example is the internet .
At home it 's completely different ; my mom is quite organized , so she always sets new rules .
There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and reports themselves , or who just do not have a computer .
Obviously , Pat first refused , but then she accepted that she was wrong , and apologized to Maria . After that , Pat never again talked about someone without his or her permission .
Third , I choose painting and golf as activities .
I had a very disappointing evening .
Shopping is not always enjoyable because of several factors .
So my art teacher came to me and my best friend , who is really good at art too , and asked whether we would be able and willing to help with the concert in two weeks at the concert hall .
It was boring .
In this day and age , technology is a fact of life .
After a few minutes I heard steps near my kitchen 's window .
How much money should I bring ?
In the next few years , people 's homes will be changing a lot .
Additionally , I felt very hungry and uncomfortable because your theater restaurant was closed , and you did not give us any reason why .
There will be activities connected with the social program , such as international evenings , sing-along parties , and indoor games .
When I arrived , it was closed .
After the conference , at about 8 p.m. , there will be a party .
I recommend you listen to it !
Also , I enjoy walking and photography .
It was really a wonderful day .
In this moment Pat wished that she never would have been keen on knowing secrets !
But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come alive .
We were thinking of so many other activities to relax and enjoy yourself besides sunbathing on the beach .
Therefore , if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games , it must be the best place for that .
He had a punctured tire and did n't know how to repair it , so I changed the tire while he asked me about my hobbies , studies , everything .
My second was to take the money at the bars and to bring them into a little room where I could see the pop stars walking in the corridor .
What can I do without my music and my computer ?
The show can be seen between 10 : 00 and 19 : 00 .
You could have hired others to do the work .
I am writing to provide information about myself .
However , computers have not only affected us in a good way , because thanks to computers , there has been a decrease in the amount of jobs that can be done by people .
Furthermore , I would like to ask you what kinds of clothes I need to take and how much money I 'll spend .
Next to the restaurant , there is a club for people who like dancing .
I saw all the pop bands and singers .
Do you recommend I take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well ?
We are looking forward to hearing from you .
I look forward to hearing from you .
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programs , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sportswear , makeup and hairstyles , etc .
It is true that science and technology affect our lives a lot .
I never forget important days because I have a databank . When an important day is coming , it notifies me .
Moreover , I have been thinking about changing the location because , as you probably already know , some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody in .
On the other hand , after shopping you 'll be tired and maybe ca n't pay your credit card .
It is a great lack of responsibility for a theater like yours to have a delay like this one .
Before the concert actually started , I had to give out lots of leaflets , which were a list of the pop bands and groups that would appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performances and backgrounds .
He accepted , and we let him go .
It 's an interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway 's work , and what he meant by " grace under pressure . "
Looking at your letter , I can see many options of activities and I realized that I like most of them .
It is quite fantastic , especially the program on March 13th when we are having a river ride to Greenwich .
It will be at the Casino Hotel , and we do n't need to worry about the best route , because all the main routes in Devonport have signs with the correct way to the popular hotel .
Bad Jon understood and immediately spoke to his father , who was the school minister , about the children 's plan .
I think that we all dream about having things .
I am so pleased I won this prize that I can not explain how grateful I am .
It was a very pleasant surprise to win a trip to California and I very much appreciate it .
I was very disappointed .
Modern technology has changed my daily life and I 'll try to explain it .
I finish my classes on the 25th of June , and in August I will be going to France with my parents .
If we came back to the past , we felt everything , it was so difficult to do , we would have plane and done by ourself and last time .
As all the travel expenses are paid already , I would appreciate it if you could tell me what kind of clothing and how much pocket money I need .
Famous people deserve also to have a private life .
Thirdly , when I bought the tickets , I asked for discounts and nobody knew anything about them , so it is false that there are discounts available .
We all know what shopping is .
When I did that , I was traveling around Japan .
On the next day , I helped them to build the scenery , and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening .
I am writing to respond to your invitation , which I have received as a first winner .
Then the weather changed again in a few minutes , and a strong storm began .
The ticket price was another problem .
Ernest Hemingway 's sentences are precise , but still very powerful and alive .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
I would prefer accommodation in the log cabins because I am not keen on tents , and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
I look forward to receiving your letter .
Could you do something about this problem ?
I will not be able to travel in August because I have found a job for that month .
But the best place for me is " La Vaguada " , an entertainment and commercial building .
And , of course , not all shops have good air conditioning .
I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part in " Camp California in the USA " .
In my opinion , this is still correct .
When I think of " the Home of the Future , " I want to have a home which is built with a new material .
Location : The castle is in the city center , near an enormous church .
I recommend you do something like that .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Nowadays , motorization is one of the most important inventions .
We have invited the students , the teachers , and the principal , but we would appreciate it if you could be there too .
You can open and close the windows and switch the lights on and off .
I would also like to do two activities , which are swimming and photography , while I am at the camp .
The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college , so the best way to get there is walking .
New technology and science will alter fabrics so they will change their color during the day .
I have a friend who knows that I speak English , so she offered me a job with an English singer . I said , " yes , of course . "
Unfortunately , it 's not possible unless you can rest in the morning .
We have n't asked for any special clothes , so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes ; although you can come well-dressed , if that feels better for you .
Besides your star 's horrible acting , there was also the show 's start time .
I used to write letters , but they take time to arrive , or sometimes disappear , so E-mail is brilliant for my life .
The two activities that I would like to do at the Camp are Sailing , which I have never done before , and Tennis , which I already play quite well .
I have been a full-time student at the university at home , and their classes all require us to have personal computers and use them at any time .
The first thing I do every day when I get up , is to prepare fantastic cappuccino with my coffee machine .
Photography is a very interesting activity , and is not too hard to do too .
The job came unexpectedly , as my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event .
There are ways to make it more fun .
It was so great to hear that I had won first prize .
While we were installing the sound system , we listened to Irish music and suddenly we saw U2 , which is my favorite group , going into the stadium and they played music for us .
I did n't tell you , but I helped at a concert just by chance .
Suddenly , Pat cried : " Oh my Lord , Bad Jon did this .
Part of the show can be filmed .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
They should know when it is too much , when they are going too far .
It opens at 7 : 30 am until late at night when the theater is closed .
My friends and I were very excited , not because of the stage decoration , but because of the pop singers and bands whom we would be able to see !
You must have TV , because you can see what 's happening in the world , and you can learn about places that you 've never been .
I did make-up for them .
An accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is the log cabin .
At the moment , I have just been to one concert .
I really enjoyed being near the pop stars . I got a lot of autographs . That was the first time I 've seen Mick Jagger . A lot of well known pop stars were there .
I had to help back stage .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
It was supposed to start at half past seven , but it started only at fifteen past eight .
Can you imagine you have all the information you need whenever you want ?
If you do n't have problems with us attending yours , we hope for a good answer .
The fact was that Pat chose to go to the year 2000 , and when he arrived , he told everyone that he was the inventor .
They keep claiming that there 's no such thing as shopping .
But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries , not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement .
It is possible that only one computer will do all this , and it will have its own personality , voice , eyesight .
Nevertheless , I stayed since I had paid .
All the waiting made me quite hungry , so I was expecting to a have good meal at the theater restaurant after the show .
Secondly , the concert halls :
By contrast , in the future , I guess we will prefer to go back to ancient times , owing to natural lifestyles .
This is one other important thing to remember .
On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a " family " .
We will have a lot of money from work .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If yes , wait until the 2100s !
Try to ask who invented the wheel or the book .
Thank you for having organized the program for our class . You must have put a lot of thought into our studies during those three days .
That is exactly what happened to me .
That has been my dream since my childhood .
There were no solutions to finally obtain a diploma .
You 'll have happy memories and you 'll be in a good mood .
It will be a great opportunity for me to see the United States .
I looked out through the window and saw a big strange " thing . "
And of course I immediately said yes !!
I remember in August 1997 , Princess Diana dying in the car crash was one of the most disastrous examples .
I felt like I was so lucky .
First , I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on stage .
Speech class should be filmed .
First of all , I do n't like and do n't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my basket ( which , by the way , has its own idea of where it wants to go ) between other desperate people 's baskets , just to find that perfect can of beans or a toothpaste . Especially when it is so hard to find anything in a modern , huge , and overly merchandise-stuffed department store .
The concerts are fabulous but the problem is the halls .
First , I would like to travel in July , because college will finish at the end of June , and I am going to go back to Japan in August .
Today , however , people do not need to spend much time on making food , washing up , or even on turning on and off the lights .
Unfortunately , I am not so good at it .
Now the only thing I have to do is go to the computer room and turn on the computer .
Why would you put that on the flyer then ?
Referent , where is the conference ?
Apart from banks and important offices , there are also the world stock market exchange , an opera theater , shopping arcades , and book and record stores .
It is normal when you are a star , that everybody wants to know all about you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
I think if we wear this clothes we will travel to every where easier than we use cars , ships , planes and space ships .
I sat and waited for forty-five minutes until the play started .
2 - They also think , that filming some of the lessons that they usually have , known as " one-to-one " lessons , people who see this video , will be interested on knowing more about the school because a few English schools have this sort of classes
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouths and noses like we have sunglasses , and that all the masks are designer brands , which are made of special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
Thank you very much .
Finally , you wrote that it was our perfect evening out , but like I said before , it was n't .
I thought it was some robbers .
It is the best way to enjoy shopping .
Also , I love traveling when the weather is warm .
But now , my cell phone is in my bag and I bring it everywhere .
We hope to see you and have a wonderful time at the party together .
Is n't that a big opportunity for us ?
If you think that fifty years ago , when there were n't cars or any sort of comfort ( born just in the " industrial age " ) everything had to be done by hands or by animal work .
Nevertheless , sometimes communications affect their lives in a negative way .
I am writing to complain about the show , " OVER THE RAINBOW " , which I saw in your theater yesterday .
Firstly , I will be able to travel only in July , because my class starts next month .
Concerning swimming , I practice this sport once a week by myself ; so I am just an amateur , not a great swimmer !
Then I woke up ; well , I shall never know what happened to the " poor cow " !
From Park Square , just go straight .
Try to give up shopping one day and spend your day with friends , going to have fun together .
For instance , you 'll want to buy everything you see , and then you wo n't know how much you have spent .
They are against democracy , I think .
When everyone in the family got up , I told them the truth , and everyone promised to say nothing .
Even food is polluted .
So they prefer to leave their sons watching TV .
There seems to be a general opinion that sports and arts and music activities such as tennis , football , orchestra , painting , and photography should be included .
One of the reasons I went to see that particular show was the starring actor announced in the ad , Danny Brook , but when the show actually started , with a forty-five minute delay , I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play .
The actor Danny Brook , whom you advertised in the brochure , did not play a part in the show .
My name is Volencia Vardez .
I am writing in order to complain about the show " Over the Rainbow " , which was played at the Circle Theatre , because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all .
I looked outside and saw two men go into the house across from mine .
You also mentioned the discounts and there were none .
He was really kind and friendly , but what I really enjoyed the most was when he invited me for a drink that night at the most luxurious pub I have ever been to .
I could n't believe my eyes .
But this time it 'll be different , I think .
My life would n't be the same in another time without this progress .
I would like to ask whether you have competitions or different activities ?
They all exploded with loud splashes .
I would also like to note that the concert halls were too small , and that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts .
Tents remind me of being in the army - I would prefer a log cabin for my stay in the camp .
Then , I go to work by motorbike .
Before I used computers , generally , it took so much time to look up words in a dictionary and to look up information .
However , there was one particular thing I really liked during the concert .
Thank you for your attention and understanding .
First , I 'm very glad to hear from you .
To sum up , there are many disadvantages as well as advantages .
You should avoid the peak times .
And I 'd like to know about what kinds of clothes to take and how much money to take too .
It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays .
It 's true this might just be my opinion , because I am a boy and think shopping is boring .
I really liked that .
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I first bought a computer when I was in university .
They come up with many ideas , which do n't last for long .
Brian learned what had happened , and at first he was angry with Pat , but then he thanked him .
When I went to buy the ticket , I tried to get a discount with my student card , but that was not possible .
It 's a boring rule .
I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of its creation is great .
On what day can I start to travel ?
The first thing that annoyed me were the forty-five minutes we were waiting for it to start .
They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often .
The ad also mentioned discounts , but that was n't true either .
On balance , I can affirm that I could n't live without this modern technology today .
" Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . " I was reading , when I suddenly heard a big bang .
I am writing to you on behalf of my class , concerning our trip to London .
The African exhibition ended just recently .
Madrid is a big city with many interesting places .
Machines such as a dishwasher , washing machine , and remote control , help us to just relax or do a little necessary work .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
We are using the equipment and area that we have to organize some activities .
You advertise that the show begins at 7 : 30 , and not at 8 : 15 , as it did .
I am fast and good at it .
About the activities listed in your letter : I choose basketball and singing .
All these facts mean that our modern way of life causes great damage to Earth .
Secondly , you have requested information about the end-of-conference party .
For just one day of my summer vacation I planned to do something adventurous .
But also , stars should n't complain at all about their fans and their loss of privacy .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you are presenting currently : " Over the Rainbow . "
It was supposed to be my perfect evening out . But it was n't .
I really hope that you consider my point of view and cash me back the value of the ticket , as soon as possible .
Thank you very much for your letter .
But we should not forget that they 're only tools and we should emphasize human relationships .
For example , nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show . It would be on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19 : 00 .
First of all , modern technology has changed daily life in the last five years more quickly than in all of ancient time , or even than ten years ago .
I find shopping to be the most time consuming .
First of all , using a computer is the most important thing for me because I can store my personal records , such as a diary or expenses , and I can send E-mail to my friends who live abroad .
I had to pay full price for them , which was quite expensive .
Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love .
One of the most interesting ones is , " The Old Man and the Sea . " It 's the story of an old seaman leaving his town to prove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught .
Although the show was supposed to start at 7 : 30 , it started at 8 : 15 , so I had to wait for an hour .
Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping center in South East London .
Why did you write that they were available ?
Finally , thank you again for everything , and I am looking forward to joining you soon .
This , again , enables people to save time .
I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives ; however I dislike the idea that such science might fall , or has already fallen , into wicked hands .
In my opinion , there 's nothing special that I 'd like to change ... maybe only this : that I would n't have to change my boots .
I would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize I have won .
Instead , there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and a terribly annoying voice .
I 'd like to know some examples .
I bought a ticket for the 7 : 30 round and the show was very , very late .
You have been presented some reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable .
But in the winter there 's still a problem to solve .
I suppose it will be better for your theater 's reputation to give at least some of my money back .
I have chosen golf because I have never played it .
I really liked the idea of visiting your theater restaurant , but because of the show 's late start , the restaurant was closed by the end of the show .
They are also the lessons which English and other foreigners are particularly interested in .
I 'm so happy and excited to receive this letter regarding how I 've won first prize in your competition .
About the accommodation , I 'd prefer to stay in log cabins , because it is more comfortable for me and my family .
For example , for work that you previously would have needed three hours to complete , you can now accomplish in ten minutes !
It is called Penrhyn Castle , and will tell you all about Wales .
My family decided to visit my grandmother in Orlando , because she had some problems with the swimming pool , so she asked my parents to help her get into a new building with a swimming pool .
I also helped with the lighting and studio equipment .
I 'm a fan of Danny Brook , so when I read his name in the advertisement , I immediately decided to go to the show .
My professor said , " go and get familiar with your computer , otherwise , you 'll fail . "
As you know , I took art for my GCSE , and fortunately , I liked it and got very good grades for my project about light and sound .
He was very kind to me ; we talked about many things , and after the concert he invited the whole team to dinner . Yes , I know what you 're thinking , " Dinner and Sting . " Yes , my friend , it was the best thing that ever happened to me .
It 's like walking in the clouds ; you feel like you 're flying .
Additionally , the advertisement said I could visit the theater restaurant after the show .
After all this introduction will be the time to show some of the activities everyone can join in at the school such as lessons , or others like the library , our protagonist having a coffee with some colleagues in the coffee bar , the reception service ...
These are my suggestions .
But from the other , everybody has the right to have a secret garden ; the right to be with his / her family without being disturbed by journalists and photographers .
According to my job , I had to help the teams with the outlights , and of course it had been my first professional experience . At the end I felt I was a member of the team , because they were so kind to me ; I collaborated a lot and learned a lot with this project .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London .
The day of the concert , we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed , and to get everything in order so the concert could be a success , which it was .
We should n't forget that for this reason the stars want to keep their private lives away from the media !
I am writing to complain about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week 's vacation in London .
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has most affected people 's way of life in industrialized countries .
First of all , you 've asked me when I want to travel .
Therefore , electric light was invented .
Which clothes should I take ?
The conference party will last until 1 : 00 AM , but everybody does n't have to stay until the end .
In addition , I suggest that they should wear casual and comfortable clothes .
Pat sent a fax to my house with the different choices she 'd thought of . Unfortunately , my grandmother was there and saw the paper , so the surprise was spoiled .
On the other hand , there is a big problem : the money .
It was so nice to hear from you last time .
In my view , the whole concert was extremely interesting and satisfying .
I think in that time , life was really harder than now !
I was very happy to receive your letter .
After all , I am sure that you understood it was n't my perfect evening out and you will give my money back .
During my visit , there were some problems that made my evening completely disappointing .
For example , without using the internet I could not get through to foreign people .
Benoni 's school is a recognized school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels , Belgium .
And , my last question : how much money should I take ?
As I understand , it is very important to confirm the date of travel .
I look forward to hearing from you .
WHAT I CAN NOT FORGIVE YOUR COMPANY FOR IS THE CHANGE OF THE STAR AT THE LAST MOMENT. MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK 'S FAN , AND HE FELT REALLY DISAPPOINTED .
IN MY OPINION , FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT , IN SOME CASES , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
I booked Palace Hotel 's restaurant for our party and it is big enough for your students .
Finally , could you let me know how the weather is in July in the States ?
The computer is helpful when I want to contact someone very quickly .
Therefore , I am interested in staying in a log cabin .
Can I wash any clothes there ?
Painting is something that I love and I am very good at it .
I played golf several years ago , and I like to paint compositions .
Please do not hesitate to contact me at ( 0297 ) 8245123 if needed .
I hope I gave you some ideas .
In my opinion , a guided tour is essential , because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art , and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and to answer all your questions .
The cafe in the hotel is available .
We arrived at the stadium the previous evening .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
He was really bad .
Also , I belonged to a golf club when I attended university in Japan .
With a computer , however , all this is done in a matter of seconds .
I did n't say anything and let her go on grieving over herself .
However , people noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their mind .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because I will have finished my exams by the end of June .
My daily life is changing .
I suggest a refund of the full price , and I hope you are willing to take responsibility .
I think that people will be as alone and jealous as they are today .
I 'd like to ask you about how much money I 'll need for two weeks in your country , and what kinds of clothes I will need to bring to Camp California next July .
Finally , I would be grateful to you if you could tell me about clothes and money .
There will be music , as well , for dancing .
The last time I was in a tent , I found it really uncomfortable ; when it rained at night , I could n't go to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent .
In my opinion , modern technology has not really changed my daily life a lot because I am just 20 years old and I used to play on the computer when I was young , or wash my clothes in the washing machine .
In addition to this , I wish I could go sailing . I have never tried it , but it seems great !
I can send email to my friend who lives in Canada .
I 'm a very outdoors-oriented person , who likes to go camping and hiking , so staying in a tent would be like a second home to me .
Linking to the internet was so popular .
Last week , I received your letter in which you told me that I won first prize .
Then the show was supposed to start at 7 : 30 , but it started at 8 : 15 , more than half an hour later .
It also holds an international exhibition all year round .
This show is about the latest fashions in leisure and sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles .
Although it is not very comfortable , I like camping very much .
And finally , your restaurant was not available after the show .
Since the electric and microwave ovens have been invented , their lives have been far easier than before .
For the first activity , I must tell you that I am very keen on singing , but that I have very little experience in it .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realized that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him . In fact , she was so angry she almost killed him , but she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
I am so excited by this news .
I have recorded a demo tape , which I can send to you if you like , in which I also play the guitar .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I was in her room , helping her .
Modern technology has completely changed my daily life , which has became more comfortable and easier .
So then we decided to access our school 's main database and change our test results .
For the handicapped , going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothersome unless shops have facilities for them .
All the students will be provided with snacks and we have managed to book a band as well .
I will ask for my money back .
In August I have to work also .
People are used to going shopping because it is easy and familiar . It is one place where you can have lunch or dinner , watch some movie after that , and if you want , buy something at the shops .
Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket , which cost me £20 .
And we have two choices to get to the conference , a bus or a train .
As I came to London on vacation and purchased " The London City Guide , " I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance .
I have to finish my study .
It was last month that I was selected .
It means the Japanese are planning for their future homes .
But , they have definitely been a very important invention .
Second , I prefer to stay in a log cabin .
Secondly , despite your advertisement of possible discounts , when I showed my student ID card to one of your employees , she angrily told me that I had to pay the whole price .
I would be glad if you would consider my suggestions .
I was n't expecting this prize because it was too good to be true .
It is the first step towards a true fraternity .
That exciting stories always describe people in difficult situations is true of Agatha Christie 's " Witness for the Prosecution . "
Therefore , I would like to ask you to refund my entrance fee , as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement .
We have discussed the program in our class , and the students are very happy about that , especially because we will have the possibility to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery .
Thank you for your letter .
However , we have to consider our nature as human beings .
You wrote an ad that people from more than 15 different countries were going to perform at this concert , but there were only artists from 6 countries .
ENGLISH : The classroom is beautiful , and we do a lot of different activities in the same day , so it wo n't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there .
I am allowed to do what I want as long as I study enough to pass .
Please contact me for more details if necessary .
I am writing to inform you about your question .
Another thing was the show 's starting time , which was forty-five minutes late .
It 's located in the city and the nearest tube station is Moorgate .
This has been scheduled for months .
Before I go on vacation , I use the internet to book a trip or get details from a travel agency , which means I can save time and energy .
I have never done light and sound for a real pop concert before , and I think it will be a good experience for me .
I had to help the director write a script of the concert and design the stage background .
You will be able to get there either by bus ( no . 150 ) , or on foot .
If you have free time , you can enjoy it watching a film .
From there to the conference you have to take bus number 50 , which stops near the hotel and arrives at the town center .
It was really disappointing !
As I have not been there before , I am rather unsure of what to wear .
Some people will do crazy things in situations like this .
Also , when I arrived at the theater , I expected to get a discount , but unfortunately I did n't .
Then we had an idea !
How have phones affected my own life ?
My favorite sports are climbing and surfing . I 'm very good at climbing , but in surfing , I need some practice .
On the last day , we have arranged a small party in the hotel , then we all set up to go sightseeing at Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for the airport .
People buy and buy unnecessary things , but when they arrive home , they see an empty wallet .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need .
When you are tired after looking around , you might want to buy drinks or something to eat . If you are fed up with historical things , you might as well just pop into a gallery to see things that are more modern .
It seemed to be the most interesting lesson , because students always make mistakes while they are practicing with their partner , in spite of having been corrected by the teacher ten times .
I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theater .
I look forward to hearing from you .
People need to rest , so they look forward to some fun during their free time such as parties and games , and everyone loves a party . It should have been filmed .
That is when I met the magic world of computers .
I was able to get some of their autographs .
I think all of these disappointments are too much for one evening .
I think that my parents let me do what I want because they trust me .
There will be a bus for students who do not want to stay at the party until the end .
The main question is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world .
Secondly , my choice is the accommodation in tents . I think it could be more interesting . I could enjoy my time with other people , playing , eating , and talking outside . In my opinion , if I choose the log cabins it will be like being at home .
For example , the advertisement said we could buy tickets with discounts , but your employees told me there were no discounts available .
I am good at swimming and playing tennis .
I ca n't imagine real vacations without a tent .
Some of them are natural , whereas others are not .
Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it .
Journalists should not follow them all the time , trying to get an interview or an " interesting " picture .
It was Gold Fish , who asked him , as a human would , " Please , let me go , and I can do for you anything you want , " but Ivan was such a kind person that he let Gold Fish go without any condition .
So the rules are clear , you need to participate in the lessons and also be successful on the exam of June 2000 .
We would also like to have a history lesson .
We did not have " a perfect evening " as it was written . Actually , we had an evening full of the theater 's mistakes and were extremely disappointed .
I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer vacation for 2 months at that time .
We had to order taxis for them , as they did n't have mobile phones .
The date is Tuesday , March 14 .
I am so happy about that , I can not even explain it .
But , it 's not easy for workers , because the shops close their doors around 5 : 30 pm ( half past five ) .
The party will take place at the Palace Hotel , which is very close to Town Hall .
I would prefer in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me .
Being a security guard was the hardest task .
They had invited us and we wanted them to see us stunningly beautiful .
So I am going to ask for a refund ...
This has made my life easier , and at the same time has saved some trees in a rainforest from being cut .
They need to be with their family in peace and quiet .
Do you think a traveler 's check would be more secure ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you very , very soon .
I have a baby and three dogs , so log cabins would be better .
I would like to know how many people will share the tent with me , and should I bring surfing gear ?
Of course , our lives have completely changed .
As you know , I 'm in Ferndown now spending the last minutes studying for exams .
I 'm rather trained in climbing ; I have done it once a month since I was 17 .
Well that 's all for now , and I hope to hear from you soon .
I do n't know when I am going to be free to go to my planet .
We got there at seven o'clock on the dot to get in line .
Seeing that this is the first year of the drama class , it is not very well known .
I am writing to you in connection with your program of spending three days in London .
We do n't think about how less than a hundred years ago , none of that existed .
As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us .
All synthetic material will be uncomfortable for these people .
I look forward to seeing you soon .
In our class , we do n't have problems with students who dislike to work , because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to stay there years and years .
There are many interesting works of art by famous painters of this country .
The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm .
I never in my life stayed in tents in the middle of nowhere , so I would prefer something more natural and new .
Then I was 15 years old .
In conclusion , I gave you a lot of reason to go to this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip in my town .
It has already started and there are no limits to where it can go .
How amazing is that ?
Early that day , I went to buy the tickets , and I decided to buy the expensive ones , as the flyer said they had discounts for people who work at the British Institute .
It will be at Central Exhibition Hall , London .
Also the Theater Restaurant was closed for some work inside .
First of all , the name of the hotel which we have been booked into is Palace Hotel .
I hope you are well .
b ) basketball and football games
I really look forward to it because I have never been to the U.S.A .
I look forward to hearing from you .
I have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit .
If you give no money back , I will go to the newspaper .
Maybe there are some occasions which I would have to pay myself .
I know my girlfriend told you I helped at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much .
I hope you can imagine my great disappointment .
You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes , but in my opinion you can be very casual .
First of all , people are able to talk to each other at any time . Be it just for fun or to discuss important and relevant things .
I believe that everyone in this world has curiosity .
It was said that there would be stars and artists from around the world in the advertisement , but , in fact , they are from only six different countries , so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year .
I suggest to organize the next IAF for the summer .
In addition , I can contact anyone I want to talk to at any convenient time in case I need him or her , or in case I am needed .
I am glad to answer your letter .
It is also free for students .
FIRST AND FOREMOST , IT 'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST MODES OF TRANSPORT .
In conclusion , I 'd like to recommend that you should , first , know what you have to offer and how to advertise it .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Lots of information in your advertisement was not correct .
Secondly , I would rather be accomodated in log cabins than in tents .
I like to go very often to look around and to buy some new clothes , as long as I am not searching for something specific .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Firstly , you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform .
I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules at school , but I do n't have enough power .
Of course , they were punished .
About the last afternoon , if I were you I would visit the City Museum .
That was the most scary and daring thing that I did in my childhood .
I had to wait for forty-five minutes .
But what kind of life is it , when you ca n't even go to a restaurant being afraid the journalists will be waiting outside for you ?
Moreover , it started at 8 : 15 instead of 7 : 30 , as you had written in the ad .
In these days , many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern way of life : air pollution by cars , soil pollution by industrial wastes .
We have to say that technological searches have had their good fruits but , at the same time , there have been negative aspects too .
It is a right like everybody else has .
Math is the most popular subject at the school .
For instance , I spent my spring break with my friends in Italy . We went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATER AND WITHOUT ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE ADMISSION .
YOUR ORGANIZATION WAS A GREAT DISASTER .
I am writing you about my disappointment with the musical , " Over the Rainbow . "
I went to Hampton Court last year , and I think it is a great place to visit .
Last week , some students from our class saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday , the 14th of March .
Take the 67 route and it will take you just in front of The Royal Hall .
I look forward to an answer !
There will be a mixture of styles from different times in the past , so if you feel like a medieval princess , you can dress like one .
However , they were very nice people .
To sum up , I enjoy wasting money and buying useful , or not so useful , things .
The concert was absolutely marvelous !
We do n't have to learn their every secret .
The conference takes place in the civic hall , so it is very simple to find .
Unfortunately , my feelings are rather bad .
Most students who were interviewed suggested the speaking part of the lesson be on film .
Other members of groups can wear a normal , pretty , formal dress .
They are very nice people , including Audrey who seems very stupid .
In conclusion , shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too busy .
My mother tried to get a doctor , but they said there were none .
Most importantly , after finishing my work , I could get a chance to meet the singers by chance
First , I would like to thank you for the program that you provided .
Finally , I wanted to know if I need money and how much , and if there is dry cleaning .
If I had a choice , I would prefer to live in a tent than in a log cabin .
The building is huge , with high technology and construction and tight security .
If I 'm not lucky enough to find some , then I 'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping place , such as London .
Everything was finally placed two days before the concert .
As a part of this , the leader of each group has to wear a traditional garment from their country .
I 'm very surprised about the good news , and I 'm sure I 'll really have a good time in California .
The show 's date is very convenient - March 14 - and it is at Central Exhibition Hall , so I do not think it would be a problem to get there .
I 'm writing because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my vacation when I went to see a play at your theater .
It was so fun . I enjoyed it a lot .
First of all , I would like to say that I am very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
I am particularly pleased to have met the most popular pop stars in the world .
Also , the internet has influence on my daily life , because I can find there many interesting things , or I can meet with people from all over the world , which is exciting for me .
Secondly , the show should have begun at half past seven . Despite this fact , the show began at a quarter to eight .
Just looking around , I realize that modern technology has crept into every area of my life .
Your visit to the store ends with a long line at the checkout ( where you can easily spend another 30 minutes ) where they will suck out some money from your account .
Concerning the proposed activities , please accept me for Singing and Painting .
My fellow students and I know that your husband has his birthday on Tuesday , the 16th of June , and we would like to have a party for him .
But I would like the opportunity to improve .
I did not expect it .
I would be glad to be able to help you .
I hope you will listen to my suggestions .
But have you thought about what kind of clothes we will wear 100 years from now ?
If you are going shopping , someone can easily steal your wallet while you are looking at some interesting things .
How did the beast know his name ?
The case of Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities .
Three years ago , when I was in Japan , my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time I got back from the school .
IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG !
The things started happening from the first day we arrived .
What is more , some concert halls were too small .
I do not know if it is possible to make any change in this plan , but we saw an ad in " Time Out " magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Generally , we are supposed to treat our parents ( as well as the teachers at school ) with respect , and not argue with our brothers and sisters .
In the evening I got a flat tire , and because of this I was late to the show ; when I got to my place , it was taken ( it was expensive ) , and they took me to the cheapest seats , where I could n't see a thing .
It is worth visiting the exhibition and we would like to go there .
For example , it provides different kinds of tours around the country . On the other hand , it is far away from the city and has few transport facilities .
I am writing to you because I was very disappointed with the promotion you publicized , in order to attract people to come to your theater .
I am writing this letter to inform you about the decisions I have made regarding your questions .
I am writing this letter to complain about the Circle Theatre .
Owing to increased demand for light for more activities , natural sources are no longer adequate .
I am writing to complain about last Saturday evening 's performance at your theater .
What changed my life most is laptops .
Walking on a city street , it 's difficult to find parks or green spaces with trees and clean air . Actually , pollution , traffic , and noise are the main problems of our society .
I read your advertisement . However , it was different from reality .
It seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon to look around the river .
They will just look funny !
And what about mobile phones ?
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautiful country .
FIRST , I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE BROCHURE .
I have no idea where to start .
Another actor took his place .
So you can help them and earn quite a bit .
Swimming is quite a nice activity for relaxing and working out .
First of all , I would like to say that the only month available for me to travel is July .
And then , you may save money for the things you like , not things to do , just for the poor things you like . It 's so funny is n't it ?
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
Firstly , I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events .
As students we do n't have much money to spend on shopping anyway , and the good thing is that it wo n't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students .
Another important class to film is Culture and Civilization , so people will know that the hostesses prepared at this school are not only , as the French say , " pot-au-fleurs " ( beautiful faces to show off ) , but also well-read people .
And we like that , because it 's easier doing nothing than engaging in doing something .
Then we can just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored , ready to eat . Then if we want to go to work we do n't have to get our horse , no , we get the car keys and go whereever we want .
When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates , and now I play at least on the weekends .
When the concert started , I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and thirsty .
In my opinion , journalists should have more respect for the private lives of famous people .
And please tell me how much money I need , excluding transport and accommodation .
That disappointed me so much .
But instead there was a different actor whom I 'd never heard about before !
Secondly , the times stated in the article were 2 : 30 and 7 : 30 .
I think it would be better for me to travel in July .
The only thing that really disappointed me was a visit to your theater where I wanted to see the musical , " Over the Rainbow , " after I read the advertisement for the show .
I really liked all the concerts , shows , and exhibitions , but why there were n't any photography exhibitions ?
It started at 8 : 15 , and that wasted my time and made me feel bad about your service .
Firstly , I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival : it is very interesting , especially for the young people .
My name is Bao-yu Liao .
And we should keep paying attention in order save our precious Earth .
First of all , I am a fan of Danny Brook 's , so your ad attracted me , but when I went there a different actor was in the musical show instead of him .
I am writing , on behalf of the students in my class , to thank you very much for the trip to London .
I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall .
That 's why Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
In my daily life , I use the facilities of modern technology very often , and it really makes my life easier .
I was pleasantly surprised to have won the first prize in your competition .
But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all over the world and I saw only six nationalities .
One day , Ivan caught a fish .
And , last but not least , is the fact that famous people ca n't express their emotions or show their real feelings in public .
The development of portable communication systems , such as mobile phones , has greatly changed our way of life .
Moreover , we can always call the police , the hospital , or a doctor for help .
But I do n't think these clothes are going to be stylish on Earth .
I can take advantage of technologies such as mobile phones , laptops , and televisions to make contact with different cultures .
I could read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there were n't .
My name is ... and I am a student representative .
Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable , but not every day .
On the last day , we are going to have about three hours of free time .
This was my secret and now it was out .
We were really pleased , because it was our first time in England .
This will make the festival better . I hope we will meet next year at the festival . I hope we will meet next year at the festival .
Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good at that , however I hope that I can learn about it at Camp .
It 's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot , which are climbing , tennis , surfing , and photography ; but if I have to make a choice , I choose climbing and surfing .
They are too small for all the people .
First of all , the actor was not Danny Brook .
It will be fantastic !
I look forward to seeing you at the conference .
I have played basketball for six years , and I 've played in competitions for five years .
I think it would be fun to stay in a tent during those two weeks . I have never done that before , but my friends told me that I would enjoy it .
The evening that I spent there was terrible , so , please , may I have my money back ?
If we do n't want to be in the newspapers , we do n't do politics or movies !
Secondly , when the show started , I was looking for Danny Brook , because he was the most important reason I went to see the show .
Since secondary school , I have been very interested in taking pictures , and I have a lot of experience .
It could be very enjoyable .
We ca n't do anything about it .
In 100 years , most of the clothes will be made from synthetic material .
If you do not return my money , I will send a letter to a lawyer .
First of all , I was looking forward to seeing one of my favorite actors , Danny Brook , and it was very disappointing to see a different actor instead of him , in spite of his name being promoted publicized on the advertisement .
I 'm also going to include the show 's leaflet on the back of this letter .
Now I hope that you can understand my request for a refund because of the trouble I had .
While there , I saw your advertisement for the show , " Over the Rainbow " , and decided to go .
The internet was something amazing for me .
Log cabins may be more comfortable , but on the other hand I think that I will be able to " survive " in tents .
Can you imagine how exciting to stay in the dark and so quiet that you can hear the sounds of animals ?
The majority have chosen history , which means a big journey around the world , either about Roman lifestyle or about the Middle Ages , when a revolution happened with deals and new lands .
After the concert , many people lost their way home , mostly foreigners who did n't know the buses ' schedule .
It takes place on Tuesday , March 14 , from 10 : 00 to 7 : 00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London .
I 'm writing to tell you about my experience last month .
Lots of people were injured , and even more were suspended the next day at school , when the Headmaster found out what had happened .
However , something wrong came up again .
That fact should be respected by the journalists .
People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary , to feel comfortable , and to stand out .
I would rather choose July because it is the only month when I get to have a vacation long enough to spend it travelling abroad .
My wife and I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago .
These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books .
In your letter , you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in tents or a log cabin . I would like to sleep in a log cabin , please .
The discounts were n't available , and your theater restaurant was n't open because the owners were away on vacation .
The festival was generally good but I have some suggestions for next year 's festival .
To begin with , we enjoy reading gossip about famous stars and politicians , although it sometimes is n't true .
The company I work for , works for Los Suaves . It 's a very famous group from my country .
So I must insist that I want to have a full refund .
I went to London last week for business . Being very much a lover of theater , I had promised my friend to offer her , after work , a very good evening with your musical show : " Over the Rainbow " .
To sum up , technology has been a great help to all of us .
I worked every day , but I did it with pleasure .
By the time it finished , I was exhausted , but I certainly enjoyed this experience because you can meet many people at a time , and what I liked most was that you can see famous stars up close and listen to their live music for free !
I am a student at a technical university .
The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad .
One more thing about the show is , it 's free for students .
Sometimes , when you go shopping on the street , you will see a lot of things that you like , and you ca n't buy at once ; you might feel very sad .
After the conference , we are going to have an informal dinner , with a previous snack time , in order to introduce each other .
I think that is a good question .
Please write me a letter as soon as possible !
We will be unwilling to give up housework .
The sea is also polluted by oil and chemical detergent which is used at home .
You are asking me to choose just 2 activities .
I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us , and therefore , Hemingway is a very good example .
They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready .
My grades were n't good enough to obtain a degree in Computer Science , and the exam session was over .
During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had a chance to see most of the performance , which was excellent .
I could then feel she was as upset as ever .
I used my computer to collect reports from the internet and I can promise I found so much information that I could n't analyze it in two weeks .
As a result , it was impossible for everyone to fit in there .
What is it like in July over there ?
But the worst thing comes at the end .
First of all , as you also know , a lot of technology has had a boost the last few years .
This is a very central hotel , located not far from the conference hall .
The boy could not believe what he was hearing .
You will see the sign for the hotel .
I would be grateful if you could arrange this show in your program .
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A COMPLETE REFUND .
Science and technology characterize our modern society .They have made big progress in our every day life and they have always become more and more important for us .
Having money and being able to spend it on anything you want is brilliant , therefore you try to turn it into an enjoyable moment .
The main character of the musical , which I 'd like to say was n't the " BEST " , was awful .
I hope you 've enjoyed my experience , and I hope to hear from you soon .
The summers and winters get warmer .
Maybe in 500 years , some people will live on Mars and then , they will have to wear other kinds of clothes .
We will make him pay .
Do I need to bring some cash with me ?
The famous detective Hercule Poirot is also there , and he finally solves the mystery . But I will not tell you more .
Secondly , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it .
When Santos Dumont first invented the airplane , he probably did n't think how people would transform his creation .
I heard them talking behind the stage .
It is also a suitable present for your cousin , I think .
It caused me to miss the train and I got back to the hotel at nearly mid-night .
It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking , computer , makeup , languages , and geography , to culture and civilization .
I FEEL THAT I WAS LIED TO , AND LIKE YOUR COMPANY IS NOT SERIOUS .
I mentioned it , but they told me that promotion had ended a long time ago .
The story describes his thoughts , fears , and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish .
I look forward to receiving your check as soon as possible .
I was glad to receive your letter .
I 'll look forward to hearing answers from you I look forward to your response .
I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the shows at your theater .
I do n't like to tidy up , you know !!
Another solution could be working as a bartender . The problem is that you go to bed very late , but it 's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night .
I would like to suggest a change in the plan of giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
First , we were asked to clear the stadium , especially the seats and surroundings .
In addition to this , the internet is quite useful and it helps to find information from all over the world .
We want to know what we will have to wear next year , but we want to know it now .
Every woman in the world likes the word " shopping " .
There , we can see everything about the latest fashions , leisure and sportswear , and makeup and hairstyles .
I remember when I was in secondary school . At that time , my friends and I were so daring and full of energy .
However , secondly , famous people are not " ailen " so that they might do something , for example , ashame things in public space or argument with partner or family even put on swimming costume like us .
So we will have free time on the afternoon of March 14th , and we can spend this time enjoying the show .
How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colors , shapes , patterns , and uses ?
Second , I would rather stay in a log cabin , because I tend to get very nervous in small , enclosed places , so a tent would be inappropriate for me .
Before all this , you could n't play on a rainy day because most games were outside the house , but now with technology you can do many things inside your house .
If you ever hear of a concert that needs volunteers , tell me - I 'm in !!!
Thank you very much for your letter regarding the prize I won in your competition .
I 'm not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , and we would like to suggest including this point in the program .
I 'm pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference .
I felt like they were really missing from my life .
Once students have taken a shower after hard physical training , they come to life . Depending on their level , they have to study , for instance , languages , which I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because it enables staff to communicate with clients in a proper way . Students have to manage to speak at least three languages .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing , above all on Saturdays , when you have finished a work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
I know I 'm " a daughter of this technological world " , and unluckily I think I could n't live without it . It 's rather strange that today there 's still anybody without a phone , dishwasher , TV ...
This interactive way of communicating allows me to reach anybody , anywhere , without restrictions .
The show was supposed to have started at 7 : 30 , but it only started at 8 : 15 , so the public , including myself , was forced to wait for forty-five minutes .
I would n't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me .
It will be on the 14th , and we all want to go .
Secondly , you should open the show on time , because if the audience has to wait , they will not be happy . But I think you know that .
Attire should be something nice , not what you would wear to a casino , for example , but casual nice , with no sports shoes or t-shirts .
It will let me get up close with nature , and experience life in the wild .
Lastly , would you tell us which is the best gift for him : a compact disk , or a book ?
First of all , the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel , which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities .
I would like to travel only in July because my boss can not give me time off for the other months of summer .
I 'm writing in reference to your letter .
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accommodation because I have had all vacations with my parents in luxury hotels .
First of all , in the description of the show , the star was announced to be Mr. DANNY BROOK , but it was n't .
The time had come . The two groups had combined their forces and were ready to strike .
This is a revolution which has changed our daily lives .
And I would like golf and painting for my activities .
I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition .
I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend the time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air .
But , I would like to make some requests for the festival .
The team of volunteers was a great one , and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed .
I am writing to share with you some feelings I have after watching a musical show that played at The Circle Theater last week .
We all very happy with your program , we especially like the idea of sightseeing by tour and the National Art Gallery .
I have n't heard from you for a long time . How are you ?
Another significant technological development is the creation of electrical appliances .
Going shopping is a good thing when you do n't know what to do , but it also has many disadvantages .
The last thing is , the theater restaurant was closed after the show , because it is only open until 9 o'clock at night .
In my opinion , we can have a great time there , and admission is free of charge for students , which is very important as well .
Another disappointing thing was that discounts were not available , which made me a bit angry .
Singing is our favorite hobby .
I can send e-mails or use the mobile phone .
I think that all these problems could have been avoided , and that asking for my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
From my point of view , the hall for rock concerts was too small , you should consider making it bigger for next year because these kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people .
I 've never gone to the USA before .
While he was unconscious , I kept asking myself , " Should I wake him up , or try to use my unsure first aid skills to deal with him ? "
The evening was a disaster , and I wonder if I do n't have the right to ask you to return my money , as I think it would be fair .
I 'm asking for my money back - you can do it , ca n't you ?
At the end of the exam session , all students and teachers meet together for a big party , to celebrate it .
That was a bit boring , but it was part of my job .
I 'd like to play golf and tennis . I 've practiced both since I was young , and I like them , but I do n't have enough time to play , and my skill level is n't as good as I 'd like .
It did n't go on as I had expected and I was really let down when it finished .
So , please , it would be fair that you give my money back .
It is a fashion revolution that is starting now .
It starts when we get up in the morning : we have machines that help us to cook , iron , clean , wash , and then when we go to work , there are cars and sky trains to help us travel conveniently and quickly .
I have n't played tennis before , so I am not good .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
As you already know , I am trying to become a professional photographer , so I would choose photography as the first activity , and painting as the second .
Can we get there by public transport ?
Concerning the information you want , I will give it .
Today , I received your letter ; it is the most wonderful news I 've heard in a long time .
I had to make sure that every artist went into their own dressing room , and not someone else 's .
Carrying big speakers place to place was extremely tiring , but we had loads of laughs .
First of all , I would like to say that it was the worst performance I had ever seen , and it disappointed me very much .
I 've been very thrilled , knowing that I won first prize in your competition .
According to your letter I have two options for accommodation , either in tents or in log cabins .
Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for a good program which provides us 3 days ' stay in London .
I 'm writing to complain about the show that I have recently attended at your theater .
Endless imagination and the development of technology will lead us to future fashion .
It is now possible to talk to a friend almost anywhere and anytime , even if we are two thousand kilometers away from each other .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions , the new hairstyles , the new leisure and sports clothes , and people teaching how to do makeup .
Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects .
Please , send me any information on what I should take with me .
They signed my diary and took a photo with me .
This report provides the information about Gyeongbokgung , which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries .
During my prior vacation in London I came across an encouraging advertisement for the show and decided to see it .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the three-day program .
I was very happy to hear from you recently . I hope you and your family are well .
But , if you do n't like children and are not easy-going enough to work as a waiter , you may chose the more peaceful job of a typist at home .
Are there any parties ?
I was very disappointed with the performance , and apart from that , there were many problems .
We can observe this problem from two different points of view .
I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition .
Since then , I live in Area 57 , and this is my daily life .
She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree .
I know you want to learn what I did and how I helped people at the pop concert last month .
Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands .
It is certain that the program will give the students considerable enjoyment .
I would like to observe the changes from the perspectives of advantage and disadvantage . From advantage , modern technology is developing toward convenience for humans .
I wonder if I can take them as well .
New fabrics create new textures ; all kinds of accessories are added to create new versions , to refresh old ideas , to make new proposals that will last , like always , just some weeks .
You falsely informed us of their existence in your advertisement .
I look forward to hearing from you .
There are more and more retailors are opening to customer .
When we finished clearing , some of us offered our help to bring the sound equipment into the stadium .
After that , I had to help people who had tickets , but could n't find their seats .
I had to bring them refreshments .
I remember when I had the first lesson in the University , and the teacher took us to the Computer Center , and I saw these machines . My whole college and I were laughing ; it was very difficult to imagine how you can work on these kinds of computers .
After a break , the band had to carry on the concert for another hour and a half .
Secondly , I would like to tell more about the end-of-conference party .
Maybe I will tell you in the next letter !
In my opinion , doing the shopping bring me a lot of satisfaction , especially if I am depressed . Nevertheless , it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
AS YOU CAN SEE , IT WASN'T A " PERFECT EVENING . "
In Japan , I often play golf , but as you know , Japanese weather conditions are not good enough to enjoy playing golf , but California has good weather , which will be sunny every day , hopefully .
in what conditions it will be spend ?
I had absolutely no choice .
We have to remember that they need a private life , just like we do .
To begin with , it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house .
I think it is also important to present a commercial English lesson ; maybe the pupils could write " offers and orders " , or classifieds , on the blackboard .
Unfortunately , it is not so cheap .
MY ADDRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE .
SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS , SO MY GRADES WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD .
The location of the party is n't fixed yet , but we will let you know after your arrival .
This is why poor Rod died .
It looked like a floating potato , a brown potato .
Will I be going out much , or just stay in Camp California the entire time ?
Shops are not for spending our lives in .
I am writing in reply to your letter saying that I have won the competition , which I ca n't believe .
I am happy to write you a letter .
I was n't sure of what to do , and the pressure of everyone watching me was driving me crazy .
At the end of the conference , we are having a party with some cold food and some drinks .
In conclusion , in my opinion , there are many advantages in my daily life at present and I would recommend people learn to use computers . Finally , I would like to say , " Enjoy your lives . "
I still go to school , and I plan on going to college next year .
She also told me that you really want to know how my experience was , so I 'll tell you some things in this letter that I 'm sure will make you glad , even though you were n't there .
I think the media must be more understanding .
This lesson will help us to be relaxed and have a laugh .
They know that if I go out with the car , I will not drink .
Obviously , Ted should have known nothing about it and we reminded Pat twice : " The party is a secret !! " , and she said , " Yes , it must be a surprise ! "
Thank you very much for granting me first prize - Camping in California .
It started forty-five minutes later .
I was struggling because I knew if I did n't help him , he would die in a short time .
I am writing in reply to your questions .
So I look forward to hearing from you soon .
It feels much better .
We will see people differently , with more calm , because we have no stress , and we are not in a hurry to do something else .
I 'm including my ticket and this list of complaints as the reason for a refund .
People will not walk on roads .
And your last phrase of the advertisement , " Your perfect evening out ! " was n't true at all , as I have explained above in this letter .
Or what do you think about going to hear a classical music concert near the conference building ?
What we are suggesting is to change the program on the afternoon of March 14th .
It 's like they lose their minds while they are shopping .
After the cocktail , the band Zero One is playing their famous songs .
Normally , I really enjoy shopping .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
Changes wo n't stop . The WAP technology is coming . You 'll buy a cake from a corner vending machine without any cash . only one call There 's digital TV , virtual reality , and more ...
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable .
From my point of view , modern technology has , first of all , permitted me to find a job , since I work as a computer engineer .
Actually , my job was not really stressful , but I had contact with , and access to , all the famous pop stars .
This world , where nations compete to be the best , could n't be more different : the airplane became the most important thing in the war .
Finally , I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement promoted , and that we all wished for , turned out to be a regret and a waste of money .
Nowadays , most people are attracted to shopping centers , which are not always enjoyable .
I could get her to simmer for a second or two , then she suddenly started shouting uncontrollably . " Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat " , hurled Olga at me , through the phone .
When the show finished , I wanted to visit the theater restaurant , but it was closed .
Second , how much money do I need ?
What is more , it was their own choice to become popular and well-known .
That was n't difficult , because everybody wanted to go .
I look forward to an answer from you .
I think you should have some next year .
We had walked for three hours ( my mother , my two brothers , and I ) through the humid and noisy jungle , looking forward to reaching a small but clean house , where a nice and friendly family , old friends of ours , used to live .
This produced a stunning effect during the concert .
Finally , here 's what you could possibly do while waiting for three hours for people to do their shopping .
I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes .
I usually stay in a tent during camping . Actually , I do n't like tents very much .
I mean , most homes are going to be like flats in buildings .
I 'd like to practice golf and tennis .
So I think that the future home could be considered this points .
I am interested in playing tennis very much .
Here in Brazil , the rules at school depend on the school .
Though , a few of us would like to consider the " London Fashion and Leisure Show . "
I was already happy to help with such a big concert as Mylene Farmer .
While we were organizing the concert , she was singing on a stage .
I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls .
A serious theater ca n't miss such an important thing as the show 's opening time .
Television has affected everyone 's daily life , too .
Will $ 200 be enough ?
INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES !
The computer has made a lot of work easy .
The aim of this report is to summarize the result of the survey , which is about making a short video .
If not , please let me know .
I was very disappointed , what else can I say .
So , did he finally win or lose ?
In my last letter , I promised to write you about my experience working at the pop concert .
Between the tent and the log cabin , I think that I would prefer the tent .
Jane and Brian were very happy .
Or asking you for too much .
Can you believe my luck ?
I fell in love with a beautiful girl , Calen , who is from Spain and was selling hot dogs .
It has been quite a long time since I last wrote to you .
Computers make some things for us nowadays , but at the speed that technology is going , in the next century , clothes will notify our doctors of our health status at any moment , any time , anywhere . People will be able to locate us around the world .
Secondly , I prefer to stay in tents , because that would be my first chance to sleep in California 's great outdoors .
I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring , I booked the ticket immediately .
Last of all , thanks for your consideration about bringing me a present .
I look forward to hearing from you .
They went into the house through a window .
I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing expedition .
