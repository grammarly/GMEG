First , there are now a lot of things that most people use at home . For example : a fridge , a cooker or just electricity .
Anna prepared the cake , Peter organized the music , Heather and I went to buy the present ; Pat said : " OK , I 'll phone some of Ted 's friends to invite them " .
I have just received your letter .
So many happy people in the crowds that the atmosphere was infectious .
But the shape and the rooms of a building will still be the same .
I think first of all we should film an English lesson , where pupils could prepare some group work or do n't .
If you would ask me , I would prefer my friends to do everything else for me . Because I am aware of the big lines to check points , crowds of people , noise ...
I would like to do singing and swimming .
Thank you very much for your kind letter .
I used to enjoy floting on the water whenever I was on holiday .
Thank you for your letter .
But after all the party was great .
I would like to go climbing and sailing while I 'm at the camp . I can climb very well . I used to climb ten years ago in my country .
It was a pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy .
I could not call my friends from another city and just say hello .
In mine , we did n't have many rules .
It highlights the background history , considers the interest of young people , and makes a final recommendation .
How have you been ?
Nowadays , for ecsample , a lot of people have a personal computer at home , and a very big part of that also has the Internet , the new frontier of computer evolution .
Will we need any special clothes and how much would you suggest I carry them for these two weeks ?
I like that , especially .
It might mean waking up early , but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip .
I was disappointed with it .
First of all because of the wide variety in the store . Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sports shoes to choose from , not , we have to choose from twenty or thirty , such as Nike , adidas or . .
The horrible thing about this is , I 'm still in heaven , but out with the wrong person , because Pat mixed the people with their names .
Sometime I stay alone all day but I have contact with many people .
There are two subjects in my class !
This evening , as you can see , it proved to be far from perfect .
In response to your question and if you do n't mind , I would prefer to travel in July because I 've already chosen my holiday and my boss wo n't give me another one .
Photography is quite interesting for me to take photographs in the place where I have never been .
I understood everything he said and said to me that I spoke English very well .
I can find out some information at home , although I do not go to the library .
I used to play tennis when I was a university student .
I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret , with a weird feeling in my heart .
Firstly , I could spend these two weeks next July only , because , before and after it , I have to work as a waiter here in my town .
I am writing to complain about the musical show , THE THE RAINBOW , and also about servic .
I 've had so much work at school recently ( exams ! ) and so many things to do that I 've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit .
The rules at home are very different .
I look forward to next year 's festival .
I am very sorry because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you to return my money and take notes of all these problems .
Thank you for giving me this great opportunity .
It is not really easy , but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them .
I must say that it was great fun . I 've never had this kind of experience before .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I look forward to meeting you at the conference .
In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by computer , but by parents themselves .
Owing to all of them , I can live very much .
Some problems of organisation seem to appear .
We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programmes , all that we have to do is watch .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in and they are n't very good .
Another simple example is my mobile telephone : A few years ago , I had to buy a telephone card and then find a telephone box to call my parents and to tell them that I would be late for dinner , or other stuff like that .
Computers might know better than humans , but there are many things which they can not replace in our life .
I 'll leave it for you .
But so , I think it was for the best , he was also in love with me .
Can I change the money on campus ?
I am looking forward to hearing the news from your group .
I just sent an e-mail and that is all !
The following year , when the bird returned to his house , he gave him a message .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Another example is the Internet .
At home it is completely different , my mum is quite organised , so she always puts on new rules .
There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and report themselves or just not having a computer .
Obviously , Pat first refused , but then she accepted that she was wrong , and after then Pat never again talked about someone in his or her permission .
Third , I chose painting and golf as activities .
I had a very disappointing evening .
Shopping is not always enjouable because of several similarities .
So my art teacher came to me and my best friend , who is really good at art too , and asked whether I could be able and willing to help with the concert in two weeks ' time in the concert hall .
This made me bored .
In the present , teachnology is a past of life .
After a few minutes I heard steps near my kitchen window .
Money : How much should I bring ?
In the next few years the people 's homes will be changing a lot .
Additionally I felt very hungry and uncomfortable because your theatre restaurant was closed and you did not give us any reason why .
Activities connected with the social programme such as international evenings , singing along parties , and indoor games .
When I arrived , it was closed .
After the conference , at about 8 pm , a party is organised .
I recommend you listen to it !
Also I enjoy walking and photography .
It was a really wonderful day .
At this moment Pat wished that she had never been keen on knowing secrets !
But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come alive .
We were thinking it is so many other people to relax and enjoy ourself than on on the beach .
Therefore , if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games , it must be the best place for this .
He had a puncture wheel and he did n't know how to repeared then I chanced the wheel and during this time he was asking me for my hobbies , studies , everything .
My second was to take the money to the bars and to bring them to a little room where I could see the pop stars walk in the corridor .
What I can do without my music and my computer .
The show can be seen between 10.00 and 19.00 .
You could hire others to do the work .
I am writing to give you information about myself .
But computers do n't have affected only in a good way because thank you to computers , the number of places of work for the people is minor .
Fathermore I would like to ask you what kind of clothes I need to take and how much money I 'll spend .
Next to the restaurant , there is a disco for people who like dancing .
I saw all the pop bands and singers .
Do you want me to take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well ?
We are looking forward to hearing from you .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make-up and hairstyles etc .
It is true that science and technology affect our lives a lot .
I never forgot any important days . Becouse I have got a welcome .
Moreover , I have been thinking about changing the location because , as you probably already know , some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody who wanted go in .
On the other hand , after shopping you 'll get tired and maybe you ca n't afford your credit card .
It is a great fault of responsability for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one .
Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets , they are a list of pop bands and groups which will appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds .
He accepted , and we left him free .
An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway 's work and what he meant by " pace under pressure . "
Looking at your letter , I can see many options for activities and I realized that I like most of them .
It is really fantastic , especially the programme on 13th March , that we are having a river trip to Greenwich .
This will be in the Casino Hotel and we do n't need to worry about the best way because in all the main routes in Devonport have signs with the correct way to the popular hotel .
Bad Jon understood and talked immediately to his father . who was the school minister about the children 's plan .
I think that " having is a dream '' of all of us .
I am so pleased that I won this prize that I can not explain how much I am .
It was a very pleasant surprise to win a trip to California , and I very much appreciate it .
I was very disappointed .
Modern technology has changed my daily life and I 'll try to explain it .
I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is for going with my parents to France .
If we came back to the past , we felt everything . It was so difficult to do . We would have plane and done by ourself and last time .
As all the travel expenses are paid already , I would appreciate it if you could tell me what kind of clothing I also need .
people people to also have a private life .
Thirdly , when I bought the tickets , I asked for discounts and nobody knew anything about them , so it is false there are discounts available .
We know everything about what shopping is .
When I did that , I was traveling around Japan .
On the next day , I helped them build the scenary , and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening .
I am writing to answer your invitation , which I have chosen as the first winner .
Then again , in a few minutes , the weather changed , and a strong storm began .
The price of the ticket was another problem .
Ernest Hemingway 's sentences are precise but still very powerful and alive .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
I would prefer accommodation in log cabins because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
I look forward to receiving your letter .
Could you do something about these problems ?
I will not be able to travel in August because I have found a job for that month .
But the best place for me is " La Vaguada " . an entertainment and commercial building .
And of'course not all shops have good conditionering .
I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part in " Camp California in the USA " .
In my opinion , this is still correct .
When I think of " the Home of the Future , " I want to have a home which is built with new materials .
Location : The castle is in the city centre near an enormous church .
I advise you to do something like that .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Nowdays <unk> is one of the most important inventions .
We have invited the students , the teachers and the principal of the school but we would appreciate it if you were coming .
You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off .
Also I would like to do two activities while I am at the Camp , which are swimming and photography .
The party is going to be in a local country near the college so the best way to get there is walking .
A new technology and science will change fabrics , so they will change their colour during the day .
I have a friend and she knows that I speak English so she offered me work with an English singer so I said " Yes , of course " .
Unfortunately , it 's not possible unless you can rest in the morning .
We have n't asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes , although you can come together , if you feel better .
After the horrible act of your star comes the starting hours .
I used to write letters but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappear so e-mail is brilliant for my life .
The two activities that I would like to do at the Camp are sailing , which I have never done before and tennis , which I already play quite well .
I have been a full-time student at the university , and their classes all require us to have personal computers and use them at any time .
The first thing I do every day , when I get up , is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffe machine .
Photography is a very interesting activitie and is not too hard to do either .
The job came unexpectedly as my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event .
There are ways of behaviour to make more fun of it .
It was so great to hear that I had won first prize .
While we were installing the sound system we listened to music and suddenly we saw U2 , which is my favourite group , going inside the stadium and they played music for us .
I did n't tell you , but I helped at this concert just by chance .
Suddenly Pat cried : " Oh my Lord , Bad Jon did this .
Part of the show can be filmed .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
They should understand when it is too much , when they are going too far .
The opening time starts from 7.30 AM. till late at night when the theatre is closed .
Me and my friends were very excited , not because of the stage decoration , but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we will be able to see !
You must have a TV because you can see what it is like in the world and you can watch some places that you do n't go to .
I did something else for them .
An accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is in log cabins .
At the moment I just went to a concert just .
I really enjoyed being next to the pop stars . I got a lot of fun , that was the first time I saw it like Jagger a lot of well-known pop stars were there .
I had to help back stages .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
It was supposed to start at half past seven , and it started at only fifteen past eight .
Can you think you have all the information you need whenever you want ?
If you do n't have any problems we attend yours , we hope you have a good answer .
The fact was that Pat chose to go to the year 2000 , and when he arrived , he told everyone that he was the inventor .
They keep claiming that there 's no such thing as shopping .
But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries , not stars from around the world , as you announced in your advertisement .
It is possible that only one computer will do this all and it will have its own personality , voice , etc .
Nevertheless , I have stayed since I had paid .
All the waiting made me quite hungry , so I was expecting to have a good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show .
Secondly , the concert halls
By contrast , in the future , I guess we would rather go back to the time , owing to having a natural lifestyle .
This is one other important thing to remember .
On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a " family . "
We would have a lot of money from the work .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If so , wait until now !
Try to ask who invented the will or the book .
Thank you for organising the programme for our class . I think you may think about a long time and how we should study for three days .
That is exactly what happened to me .
That has been my dream since my childhood .
There were no solutions to finally obtaining the diploma .
You 'll have happy memories and a good mood .
It will be a great opportunity for me to see the United States , and I am so happy about that . I can not explain it .
I looked out through the window and saw a strange " thing . "
And of course I immediately said yes !!
I remember that in August 1997 , Princess Diana died in the car crash , which was one of the most disarster examples .
I felt how lucky I was .
Firstly , I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on stage .
Speaking class should be filmed .
First of all , I do n't like and do n't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley ( which , by the way , has its own idea of where it wants to go ) between other desperate people , baskets , just to find that perfect tin of beans or a toothpaste . Especially since it is so hard to find anything in a modern , huge , and stuffed store with lots of merchandise department stores ,
The concerts are fabulous but the problems are the halls .
First , I would like to travel in July . Because my college will finish at the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August .
Today , however , people do not need to spend many times on making food , washing up , or even turning on an off-the-light .
Unfortunately I am not so good at it .
Now the only thing I have to do is to go to the computer room and turn on the computer .
Why do you put it on the paper then ?
Referent , where is the conference ?
Apart from banks and important offices , There is also a world stock market exchange , opera theatre , shopping <unk> , books , and records stores .
Is it normal when you are a star that everybody wants to know all about you ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
This means engineering will find the way to useless petrol for it , so it will be useful in the future .
I was sitting and waiting for forty-five minutes until the play started .
2 - They also think that filming some of the lessons that they usually have , known as " one-to-one " lessons , people who see this video will be interested in knowing more about the school because a few English schools have this sort of class .
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouthes and noses like we have sun-glasses , and that all the masks are designer brands , which are made of special materials to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
Thank you very much .
At last you wrote that it was our perfect evening out , but as I said before , it was n't .
I thought it was some better .
It is the best way to enjoy shopping .
I love travelling when the weather is warm .
Yet my phone is in my bag and I bring it everywhere .
We hope to see you at the party and have a time together .
Is n't it a big opportunity for us ?
They have made a big progress in our everyday life and they have always become more important for us .
Nevertheless , sometimes communication disturbs their lives in a wrong way .
I am writing to complain about the musical show " OVER THE RAINBOW " which I saw in your theatre yesterday .
Firstly , I will be able to travel just in july because my class starts the month after this .
Concerning swimming , I practise this sport once a week on myself , so I am just an amateur , not a great <unk> !
Then , I woke up ; well , I shall never know what happened to the " poor cow " !
From Park Square , just go straight .
Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends to play something together .
For instance , you want to buy everything which you see , and after that , you do n't know how much you have spent .
They are against democracy , I think .
When all the family got up , I told us the truth , and all promised to say nothing .
Even though food is polluted ,
So they prefer to leave their sons TV .
There seems to be a general opinion that sports , art and music activities such as tennis , football , orchestra , painting , and photography should be included .
One of the reasons I went to see that particular show was the starring actor announced in the ad Danny Brook , but when the show actually started , with a forty-five minute delay , I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play .
The actor ' Danny brook ' , whom you advertised in brocher , did not play a part in the show .
My name is Volencia . .
I am writing in order to complain about the show " Over the Rainbow " , which was played in the " Circle Theatre " , because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all .
I outside outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine .
You also mentioned the discounts and there were not any .
He was really kind and friendly but really what I really enjoyed most about it was when he invited me tonight for a drink in the most luxurious pub I have ever been to .
I could n't believe my eyes .
But this time , it 'll be different , I thought .
My life would n't be the same another time without these progress .
I would like to ask if you have competitions or different activities .
They all exploded with loud <unk> .
Then , I want to say that the concert halls were too small , that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts .
Tents remind me of the time when I was in the army - I would prefer a log cabin for my stay in the camp .
Then I go to work by motorbike .
Before I used computers generally , it took so much time for me to look up words in a dictionary and look up for information .
However , there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert .
Thank you for your understanding .
Firstly , I 'm very glad to hear from you .
To sum up , there are many disadvantages as well as advantages .
You should avoid peak times .
And I 'd like to know what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too .
It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays .
For me my opinion on this one is true : it is boring , it might be because I am a boy .
I especially liked that time .
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I first bought a computer as I was at university .
They come up with many ideas but it ca n't last for a long time .
Brian said what had happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him .
When I went to buy the ticket I tried to get a discount with my student card , but that was not okay .
It 's a boring rule .
I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of its creation is great .
On what day can I start my trip ?
The first thing that annoyed me was the forty-five minutes we were waiting for the beginning .
They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often .
The ad also mentioned discounts , but that was n't true either .
On balance , I can affirm that I could n't without modern technology today .
" Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , " I was reading when I suddenly found a big bang .
I am writing to you on behalf of my class concerning our trip to London .
Recently , the exhibition of africa just finished .
Madrid is a big city and has many interesting places .
Machines , such as a dishwasher , laundry machine , and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Using the equipment and area , we have to organise some activities .
You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20 : 15 as it did .
I am good and fast at swimming .
About the activities listed in your letter , I chose basketball and singing .
All these facts mean that our modern life gives great damage to the earth .
Secondly , you have required information about the end-of-conference party .
For just one day in my summer holidays , I planned to do something adventurous .
As well as this , the stars should n't complain at any time about their fans and their loss of privacy .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you present at the moment : " Over the Rainbow " .
It was supposed to be my perfect out out . But it was n't .
I really expect that you consider my arguments and cash me back the value of the ticket as soon as possible .
Thank you very much for your letter .
However , we should not forget that it 's only tools and emphazise human relationships .
For example , nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show . It will be on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00 .
First of all , modern technology has changed my daily life the last five years more quickly than in the last ten years , or even ten years ago .
I find shopping is the most time-consuming one .
First of all , using a computer is the most important for me because I can store my personal records such as diary or expenses and I send e-mail to my friends who live abroad .
I had to pay the full price for them , which was quite good .
Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love .
One of the most interesting ones is " The Old Man and the Sea " . A story of an old seaman leaving his town to say that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught .
Although the show was supposed to start at 19=30 , it started at 20=15 , so I had to wait for an hour .
Bromley town centre is the most beautiful shopping centre in Southeast London .
Why did you write that they were available ?
Finally , thank you again for everything , and I am looking forward to accompanying you soon .
This again enables people to save time .
I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives ; however , I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or have already fallen in wicked hands .
In my opinion there 's nothing special that I 'd like to change , maybe only this , that I would n't have to change my boots .
I would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize I have won .
Instead , there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and a terribly annoying voice .
I 'd like to know some examples .
I bought a ticket for the 19.30 round and the show was very late .
You have been presenting some reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable .
But in the winter there 's still a problem which is to solve it .
I suppose it will be better for your theatre 's reputation to give at least some of my money back .
I have choosen golf because I have never played this game .
I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant , but because of the late start of the show , the restaurant was closed by the end of the show .
They are also the lessons which English and other foreigners are particularlly curious about .
I 'm so happy and excited to receive this letter about what I 've won the first prize in your competition .
About the accommodation , I 'd prefer to stay in log cabins , because for me and my family are more comfortable .
For works that you needed , for example three hours you can do them in ten minutes ; the same !
It is called Penrhyh Castle , as the building will tell you all about Wales .
My family decided to visit my grandmother in Orlando , because she had some problems with the swiming-pool ; she asked my parents to help her in a new swiming pool building .
I also helped with the lighting and studio equipment .
I 'm a fan of Danny Brook so when I read in the advertisement his name I immediately decided to go to the show .
My professor said , ' Go and get familier with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail ' .
As you know , I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I liked it and got quite good marks for my project , about light and sound .
He was very kind to me . We talked about many things and after the concert he invited all the team to have dinner . Yes I know what you 're thinking , " Dinner and Sting " Yes , my friend , it was the best thing in my life .
It 's like walking in the clouds , you feel like <unk> .
Additionally , the advertisement said I could visit the restaurant after the show .
After all this introduction , it will be time to show some of the ingredients everyone can join in the school , such as lesons or others like the library , our protagonist having a cofe with some coleagues in the cofe bar , the reception service ..
These are my suggestions .
But from the other hand , everybody has the right to have a secret garden , the right to be with his / her family without being disturbed by journalists and photographers .
According to my job , I had to help the teams with outlights and of course it was my first proffesional experience : in the end I felt like a member of them , because they were so kind to me , and I could learn a lot from this project .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisement for a fashion and leisure show in London .
On the day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to have everything in order so the concert could be a succes , which it was .
We ca n't forget that for this reason the stars want to keep their private lives away from the media !
I am writing to complain about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week 's holiday in London .
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries .
First of all , you asked me when I wanted to travel .
There , electric lights have been invented .
Which clothes should I take ?
The conference party will last at 1.00 AM , but everybody does not need to stay until the end .
In addition , I suggest that they should wear comfortable clothes .
Pat sent me a fax with the different alternatives she thought but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the sorprise was ended .
On the other hand there is a big problem : money .
It was so nice to hear from you last time .
In my view , it was extremely interesting and for for me all the concert long .
If you think that fifty years ago , when there were n't cars or any sort of comfort ( born just in the " industrial age " ) everything had to be done by hand or by animal work : I think in that time life was really harder than now !
I was very happy to receive your letter .
After all I am sure that you understood it was n't my perfect evening out and you will give me my money back .
During my visit there occurred some problems that made my evening completely disappointing .
For example , without using the Internet , I could not put myself through to foreign people .
Benoni 's school is a recognised school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels Belgium .
And the last one . How much money should I take there ?
As I understand it is very common to confirm the date of travelling .
I look forward to hearing from you .
BUT WHAT CAN NOT I FORGIVE TO YOUR COMPANY IS TO CHANGE THE START AT THE LAST MOMENT , MY <unk> IS A DANNY 'S 'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISSAPOINTED .
IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING THAT THAT IN SOME CASS , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
I booked the Palace Hotel 's restaurant for our party and it is big enough for your students .
Finally , could you let me know what the weather is like in July in the States ?
The computer is OK when I want to contact somebody very fast .
Therefore , I am interested in staying in a log cabin .
Can I wash any clothes there ?
Painting is something that I love and I am very good at doing it .
I used to play several years ago and I like to paint the composition .
Please do not hesitate to contact me at ( 0297 ) in in case of need .
I hope I have given you some ideas .
In my opinion a guided tour is essential , because Bourne Castle is a historic place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions .
The cafe in the hotel is available .
We arrived at the stadium the previous evening .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Really he was bad .
Also , I belonged to a golf club when I went to university in Japan .
With a computer , however , all this is done in the matter of seconds .
I did n't say anything and let her go on grieving herself .
However , people noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their minds .
First of all I would like to travel in July because I will have finished my exams by the end of June .
My daily life is changing .
I suggest a refund of the full price and I hope you are willing to take your responsibilities .
I think that people will be as alone and lonely today .
I 'd like to ask you about how much money I 'll need for two weeks in your country and what sort of clothes I have to bring to Camp California next july .
Finally , I would be grateful to you if you told me about clothes and money .
There will be music as well for dancing .
Because last time I was in a tent , I found it really uncomfortable and when it occurred in the evening I could n't get to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent .
In my opinion modern technology has changed my daily life not really a lot because I am just 20 years old and I used to play computer when I was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine .
In addition to this , I wish I was going to sail : I have never tried it , but it seems to be great !
I can send an email to my friend who lives in Canada .
I 'm a very outdoor person , who likes to go camping and hiking , so staying in a tent is like a second home to me .
Linking to the Internet was so popular .
Last week I received your letter in which you told me that I won first prize .
Then the show was meant to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20 : 15 , more than half an hour later .
It also held an exhibition all year round .
This show is about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make-up and Hairstyles .
Although it is not very comfortable , I like camping very much .
And finally , your restaurant was not available after the show .
Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their lives have been far easier than before .
For the first activity , I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very little experience in it .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him . In fact , she was so angry she almost killed but she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
I am so excited about the news .
I have recorded a demo tape , which I can send to you if you will , in which I also play the guitar .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I was in her room and helped her .
Modern technology has changed my daily life , which has become more comfortable and easier .
So , we decided to access our school 's main database and change our test results .
For the handicapped , going shopping is not easy and it can be very dangerous unless shops have facilities for them .
All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well .
I will ask for my money back .
In August I have to work .
People are used to going to the shopping centre because it is easier and more fun . It is one place where you can have lunch or dinner , watch some movies after that , and if you want , buy something at the shops .
Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket , which cost me £20 .
And we have two choices : to get to the conference , a bus or a train .
As I came to London on holiday and purchased " The London City Guide " I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance .
I have to finish my studies .
It was last month that I was selected .
It means the Japanese are planning for the future home .
But , they they have been a very important invention .
Second , I prefer to stay in a log cabin .
Secondly , despite your advertisement for the possibility of discounts , when I showed my student identity card to one of your employes she told me that I had to pay the whole prize .
I would be glad if you considered my suggestions .
I did n't expect this prize because it was too good to be true .
It is the first step toward a true fraternity .
That exciting story always describes people in difficult situations as true of Agatha Christie 's " Witness for the prosecution . "
Therefore , I would like to ask you for my entrance fee , as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement .
We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that , especially because we will have the opportunity to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery .
Thank you for your letter .
However , we have to consider our nature and culture .
You wrote an advertisement that people from more than 15 deferent countries were going to visit this concert , but there were artists from only 6 countries .
ENGLISH : the classroom is beautifull , and on the same day we do a lot of activities , so it wo n't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there .
I am allowed to do what I want , as long as I studie enough to aprove .
Please contact me for more details if necessary .
I am writing to inform you about your question .
Another thing was the start time . The show started forty-five minutes late .
It is located in the city and the nearest tube station is Moorgate Station .
This was scheduled 3 months ago .
Before I go on holiday I use the Internet to book or get details from a travel agency , which means I could save my time and physical energy .
I have never done light and sound for the real pop concert before and I think it will be a good experience for me .
I had to help the director write a script for the concert and design the background of the stage .
You will be able to get there either by bus ( no 150 ) or on foot .
You can enjoy your time watching a film if you have free time .
From there to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus , which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town centre .
It was really disappointing !
As I have not been there before , I am unsure of what to wear .
Some people will do crazy things in situations like this .
And then , when I arrived at the theatre , I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly I did n't .
Then we had an idea !
How has the phone affected my own life ?
My favourite sports are climbing and surfing . I 'm very good at climbing but for surfing I need some practice .
On the last day , we arranged a small party in the hotel , then we all set up to have a sightseeing Bromley town centre for about two hours before you leave for the airport .
People buy and buy unnecessary things , but when they arrive in their houses , they can see an empty wallet .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need .
When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical things , you migh as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
It seemed to be the most interesting lesson , because students always make some mistakes while they are practising with their partner , in spite of having told teachers ten times .
I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theatre .
Looking forward to hearing from you ,
People must get some rest often , and as a result they look forward to some happiness at free time such as party , games , and everyone loves party . It should have been filmed .
That time I met the magic world of computers .
I was able to have some signatures for them .
I think all of these things are too much for one evening .
I think that my parents let me do what I want because they trust me .
There will be a bus taking students who do not need to stay at the party until the end .
The main is the ozone hole , which affects all the people in the world .
Secondly , my choise is the accommodation in tents . I think it could be more interesting . I could enjoy my time with other people playing , eating and talking outside , in my opinion if I choose the log cabins it will be like being at home .
For example , the advertisement said we could buy tickets with discounts , but when I went to buy them your employees told me there were no discounts available .
I am good at swimming and playing tennis .
I ca n't imagine real holidays without a tent .
Some of them are natural , whereas others are not .
Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one can imagine life without it .
Journalists should not follow them all the time , trying to do an interview or taking an ' interesting ' picture .
But Ivan was such a kind person that he let Gold Fish go without any condition .
So the rules are clear , you need to participate in the lessons and also be successful in the exam of June 2000 .
We also would like to have a history .
We did not have " a perfect evening " as was written . Actually we had an evening full of the theatre 's mistakes and were extremely disappointed .
I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time .
We had to order taxis for them as they did n't have mobile telephones .
The date is Tuesday , March 14 .
I 'd love to hear all your news . Why do n't you come and visit me ?
But , it 's not easy for workers , because the shops close their doors about 5.30 pm ( half past five ) .
The party will take place in the Palace Hotel . The hotel is a very close town hall .
I would prefer a tent because I think that is something more exciting and new for me .
Being a security guard was the hardest task .
They had invited us and we wanted them to see us as beautiful .
So I am going to ask for a refund ...
This made my life easier and , at the same time , saved some trees in a rainforest from being cut .
They decided to be with their family in silence .
Do you think travel chaque would be more secure ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you very , very soon .
I have a baby and three dogs , so it should be better in log cabins .
I would like to know about how many teenagers will stay with me in the tent , and have a take with me special clothes for doing anything .
Of course , our lives will be completely changed .
As you know I 'm in Ferndown now spending the last few minutes studying for exams .
I 'm rather trained in climbing . I have done it once a mounth since I was 17 .
Well that 's all for now and I hope to hear from you soon .
I do n't know when I am going to be free , to go to my planet .
At seven o'clock on the dot we went there to start again .
Seeing that this is the first year of the drama lessons , it is not very well known .
I am writing to you regarding your programme of spending three days in London .
We do n't think that there are less than a hundred years old , nothing of that existed .
As you know , we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us .
All syntetic material will be uncomfortable for these people .
I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
In our class , we do n't have a problem with students who dislike working , because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say their years and years .
There are many interesting works of art by famous painters of this country .
The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm .
I never stayed in tents in the middle of nowhere , in my life , so I would prefer something more realistic and new .
Then I was 15 years old .
Conclusion : I have given you a lot of reasons to get to this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip to my town .
It has already started and does n't have a chance to go .
How amazing is that ?
Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones , as the promotion paper said they had discounts for people that worked at the British Institute .
It will be at the Central Exhibition Hall , London .
Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for some working inside .
First of all , the name of the hotel which we have booked is Palace Hotel .
I hope you are well .
b ) basketball and football games ;
I really look forward to it because I have never been to the USA before .
I look forward to hearing from you .
I have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit .
If you give me no money back , I will go to the newspaper .
Maybe there are some occasions when I have to pay for myself .
I know that my girlfriend told you that I was helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much .
I hope you can imagine my great disappointment .
You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear them very much .
Firstly people are able to talk to people at any time . Be it - just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins .
I believe that everyone in this world has curiosity .
It was said that stars and artists from around the world are in the advertisement , but in fact they are from only six different countries , so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year .
I suggest organizing next IAF in the summer .
In addition to these , I can contact anyone who I want to talk to at any convenient time in case I need him or her or I am needed .
I am glad to hear your letter .
It is also free to enter students .
FIRST AND FOREMOST , IT 'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL THE THE WORLD BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST WAYS OF TRANSPORT .
In conclusion I 'd like to say that you should first know what you have to offer and the advertising it .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Lots of information in your advertisement is not correct .
Secondly , I would rather stay in log cabins than go in tens .
I like to go very often , to look around and to buy some new clothes . As long as I am not searching for something specific ,
I look forward to hearing from you .
Firstly , you said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform .
I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school , but I do n't have enough power .
Of course , they were punished .
With reference to last afternoon , if I were you I would visit the City Museum .
That was the most common thing that I did in my childhood .
I had to wait forty-five minutes for forty-five minutes .
But what life is it , when you ca n't even go to a restaurant being afraid of , the journalists will be waiting outside for you ?
Moreover , it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 , as you had written on it .
These days , many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern life . Air pollution by cars , Soil pollution by industrial waste .
We have to say that technological searches have taken in our society " their good fruits " but , at the same time , negative aspects too .
It is a right like everybody from us has .
Maths is the most popular subject in school .
For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy . We went there to buy our dresses for our graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
YOUR SHOW ONE ONE ONE HOUR LATER AND WITH ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE ENTRY .
YOUR ORGANISATION WAS A GREAT <unk> ,
I am writing to you to show my disagreement with the musical show ' Over the rainbow .
I went to the Hampton Court last year , and I think it is a great place to visit .
Last week some students from our class saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March .
Take the 67 route , and it will take you just in front of The Royal Hall .
I am looking forward to your answer !
There will be a mixture of styles from different times of the past , so if you feel like a medieval princess , you can dress like one .
However , they were very nice people .
To sum up , I enjoy wasting money and buying useful things or not .
The concert was absolutely marvellous !
We do n't have to learn about them every second .
The conference is organised in the civic hall so it is very simple to find it .
my my feelings are rather bad .
Most students who were interviewed suggested having a speaking part of the lesson to be on film .
Other members of the group can wear a normal pretty formal dress .
They are very nice people , even those who seem very stupid .
In conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too noisy .
My mother tried to get a doctor , but they said there was no one .
Foremost , after finishing my work , I could meet singers by chance !!
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the programme that you provided .
Finally , I wanted to know if I needed money and how many , and if there was a dry cleaning .
If I had a choice , I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin .
The building is huge , with high technology and construction and tight security .
If I 'm not lucky enough to find one , then I 'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping place such as London .
Everything was finally planed two days before the concert .
As a part of this , the leader of each group has to wear a costume of her country .
I 'm very surprised about the good news and I 'm sure I 'll really have a good time in California .
The show 's date is very convenient - March 14 - , and it is at the Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there .
I 'm writing to you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play at your theatre .
It was such fun that I enjoyed it a lot .
First of all I would like to say that I am very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
Particularly I am pleased to know the most popular pop stars in the world .
Also Iternet has an influence on my daily life , beause I can find there many interesting things , or I can meet with people from all over the world , which is exciting for me .
Secondly , the show should begin at half past seven . Despite this fact the show began at a quarter to eight .
Just looking around , I realise that modern technology has become part of every area of my life .
You visit the shop conludes in a long queue to the checkout ( where you can easily spend another 30 minutes ) where they will suck out some money from your account .
Concerning the proposed activities please , accept me for Singing and Painting .
My fellow students and I know that your husband has his birthday on Tuesday the 16th of June and we would like to organise a party for him .
but I would take the opportunity to improve myself .
I did not expect it .
I would be glad to be able to help you .
I hope you will listen to my suggestions .
But have you thought about what kind of clothes we will wear 100 years from now ?
If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet , which you are looking at some interesting things .
How did the beast know his name ?
The case of Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities .
Three years ago , when I was in Japan , my parents were both working , and neither of them were at home by the time I got back from school .
IT WAS <unk> <unk> !
Things started happening from the first day we arrived .
What is more , some concert halls were too small .
I do not know if it is possible to make any change in this plan but we saw an ad in " Time Out " magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Generally , we are supposed to treat our parents ( as well as the teachers at school ) with respect and not to argue with our brothers and sisters .
In the evening I got a flat tire , and because of this I got late for the show . When I got to my place , it was used ( it cost a lot ) and they took me to the cheapest seats , where I could n't see a thing .
It is worth visiting the exhibition and we would like to go there .
On the other hand it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities .
I am writing to you . I was very disappointed with the presentation you have made to attract people to come to your theatre .
I am writing this letter to tell you about the decisions I have made according to your questions .
I am writing this letter to complain about the Circle Theatre .
Owing to the increasing demand for light for more activities , the natural source is not adequate .
I am writing to you to complain about the last saturday evening performance in your theatre .
What changed my life most is portal computers .
Walking on a city street , it 's difficult to find parks or " green " places with trees and clean air : pollution , traffic and noize are the main problems of our society .
I read your advertisement . However , it was different from the fact .
It seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking through the river .
They just look funny !
And what about mobile telephones ?
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that country .
FIRSTLY I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE BROCHURE .
I have no idea where to start .
Another actor took his place .
So , you can help them and earn enough enough .
Swimming is quite a nice activity to relax and work out .
First of all , I would like to say that the only month available for me to travel is July .
And then , you may save money for the things you like , nothing to do , just for the poor things that you like so funny is n't it ?
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
Firstly , I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events .
Anyway , as students , we do n't have much money to spend on shopping and the good thing is that it wo n't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students .
Another important lesson to film is " culture and civilization , therefore people will know that the hostessess at at this school are not only , as the French say , " pot-au-fleurs " , beautiful faces to show off but also well-read people .
We like that because it 's easier nothing doing than engaging ourselves in something that makes us do something .
Then we can just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored and ready to eat . If we then want to go to work we do n't have to get our horse , no , we get the car keys and go wherever we want to .
When I was a child , I used to play daily with my classmates , and now I am playing at least at the weekend .
When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and <unk> .
In my opinion journalists should have more respect for the private life of famous people .
And please tell me how much money I am supposed to need , excluding transport and accommodation .
That disappointed me .
But , instead there was a different actor , who I had never heard about before !
Secondly , in the article , the times were 14 : 30 and 19 : 30 .
I think it would be better for me to travel in July .
The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit to your theatre where I wanted to see the musical ' over the rainbow ' , after I read the advertisement for the show .
I extremely liked all the concerts , shows , and exhibitions , but why were n't there any photograph exhibitions ?
It started at 20 : 15 and that waisted my time and made me feel bad about your service .
Firstly , I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival . It is very interesting , especially for young people .
My name is Bao-yu . .
And we should keep our attention paid in order to save our precious earth .
Firstly , I am a fan of Danny Brook so your advert attracted me but when I went there a different actor was in the musical show instead of him .
I am writing , on behalf of the students in my class , to thank you very much for the trip to London .
I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall .
That 's why Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
In my daily life , I use the facilities of modern technology very often and it really makes my life easier to live .
I was surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition .
But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all over the world and I saw only six nationalities .
One day , Ivan caught a fish .
And last , but not least , is the fact that famous people ca n't express their emotions , showing their real feelings to the public .
The developpement of portable communication systems , such as mobile phones , has greatly changed our way of life .
Moreover we can always call for help to the police , to the hospital or to a doctor .
But I do n't think these clothes are going to be fashionable on earth .
I can take advantage of those technologies such as mobile phones , laptop computers , and television to have contact with different cultures .
I read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there were werent .
My name is ... and I am a student representative .
Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not every day .
On the last day we are going to have about three hours ' free time .
This was my secret , and now it was not .
We were really pleased because it was our first time in England .
This will make the festival better . I hope we will meet next year at the festival .
Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good at that , however I hope that I can learn about it at the Camp .
It 's quite good for me because there are 4 of them . I like climbing a lot , tennis , surfing and photography , but if I have to make a film , I choose climbing and surfing .
They are too small for all the people .
First of all , the actor was not Danny Brook .
It will be fantastic !
I 'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
I have played basketball for six years , and I 've been in competitions for five years .
I think it would be fun to stay in a tent for those two weeks . I have never done that before , but my friends told me that I would enjoy it .
The evening that I spent there was terrible so please may I have my money back .
If we do n't want to be in the newspapers , we do n't do politics or movies !
Secondly , when the show started , I was looking for Danny Brook , because this actor was the most important reason for me to come here .
Since secondary school I have been very interested in taking pictures and I have a lot of experience in it .
It could be very enjoyable .
We ca n't do anything about it .
In 100 years most of the clothes are made from material <unk> .
If you do not return my money I will send a letter to a lawyer .
First of all , I was looking forward to seeing one of my favourite actors , Danny Brook , and it was very disappointing for me to see a diferent actor instead of him in spite of his name being writen in the advertisement .
I also include the show 's leaflet on the back of this letter .
Now I hope that you can understand my question about some money back because of the trouble I had .
While there I saw your advertisement for the show " Over the rainbow " and decided to go .
The Internet was amazing for me .
Log cabins may be more confortable , on the other hand I think that I will be able to " survive " in tents .
Can you imagine how much we stay in the dark and very quiet and we can hear the sound of animals .
The majorite has chosen history , which means a big journey around the world , either at the Roman lifestyle or in the age of midle , when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands .
After the concert many people lost their way home , mostly foreigners who did n't know the buses ' schedule .
It takes place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 at the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
I 'm writing to tell you about my experience last month .
Lots of people injured injured and even more were suspended the next day at school , when the Headmaster found out what had happened .
However , something wrong came up again .
That fact should be respected by journalists .
People spend a lot of money buying something extraordinary , feeling comfortable , and standing out .
I would rather choose July because it is only one month when I have got a holiday , long enough to spend it travelling abroad .
My wife and I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago .
These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books .
In your letter you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in tents or log cabins , and I would like to sleep in a log cabin please .
The discounts were n't available and your theatre restaurant was n't open , because the owners were on holiday .
The festival was generally good but I have some suggestions for next year 's festival .
To begin with , we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians , although they sometimes are n't true .
The company I work for works for Los Svaves is a very famous group from my country .
So I must insist that I want to have a full refund .
I went to London last week for business and loved theatre very much . I had promised my friend to offer her , after work , a very good evening with your musical show : " Over the Rainbow " .
To sum up , technology has been a great help to all of us .
I worked all day , but I did it with pleasure .
By the time it finished , I was exhausted , but I certainly enjoyed this experience as you can meet many people at a time and what I liked most was that you can see famous stars very close and listen to their live music for free !
I am a technical univercity student .
The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad .
One more thing about the show is it 's free for students .
Sometimes , when you shop in the street , you will see a lot of things that you like , and you ca n't buy them once . You will feel very sad maybe .
After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce each other .
I think that is a good question to think about .
Please write me a letter as soon as possible !
We will be unwilling to give housework away .
The sea is also polluted by oil and chemical <unk> which is used at home .
You are asking me to choose just 2 activities .
I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us . Therefore , Hemingway is a very good example .
They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready .
My marks were n't good enough to obtain my degree in Computer Science , and the exam session was finished .
During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had a chance to see most of the performance , which was excellent .
I could then feel her upset as ever .
I used my computer to collect reports from the Internet and I can promise I found so much information that I could n't analize it in two weeks .
As a result , it was impossible for the audience to fit in there .
What does it like in July over there ?
But the worst thing comes in the end .
First of all , as you also know , lots of technology has boosted for a few years .
This is a very central hotel located not far away from the conference hall .
The boy could not understand what he was hearing .
You can see the sign of a hotel .
I would be grateful if you could arrange these shows for your programme .
I WANT YOU TO ME TO COMPLETE ME .
Science and technology characterize our society .
Having money and being able to spend it on anything you want is brilliant ; therefore , you try to turn it in an enjoyable moment .
The main character of the musical show , which I 'd like to say was n't the " BEST " , was <unk> .
I think you 've enjoed my experience , and I hope to hear from you soon .
The sommers and winters get warmer .
Maybe in 500 years , some people will live on Mars and then they have to wear other kinds of clothes .
We will make him pay .
Do I have to bring some cash on me ?
There is also Hercule , the famous detective and he finally solves the problem . But I will not tell you any more .
Secondly , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it .
At first , when Santos invented the airplane , he probably did n't think how the people could transform his creation .
I heard them talking behind the stage ,
It is also a suitable present for your cousin , I think .
It caused me to miss the train and I went back to the hotel nearly in the evening .
It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking , computer , make-up , languages , geographie to culture and civilization .
I FEEL YOU LIE ME AND YOUR COMPANY IS NOT <unk> .
I mentioned it , but they told me that the promotion had ended a long time ago .
The story describes his feelings , thoughts , fears , and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish .
I look forward to receiving your reply as soon as possible .
I was glad to receive your letter .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the show at your theatre .
I do n't like to tidy up , you know !!
Another solution could be working as a barman , the problem is that you go to bed very late , but it 's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night .
I would like to suggest a change in the programme by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Firstly , we were asked to clear the stadium , especially the seats and surroundings .
In addition to this , doing the Internet is quite useful and helpful to have information from all over the world .
We want to know what we will have to wear next year but we want to know it now .
Every woman in the world likes word shopping .
There we can see everything about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make-up and <unk> .
I remember when I was in secondary school . At that time , my friends and I were so tired and full of energy .
However , secondly , famous people are not " ailen " so that they might do something , for example , things things in public space or argument with partner or family even put on swimming costumes like us .
So we will have some free time in the afternoon of the 14th March and we can spend this time enjoying the show .
How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours , shapes , patterns , and uses ?
Second , I would rather stay in a log cabin , because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places , so a tent would be better for me .
On an early day , on a rainy day you could n't play because most games were outside the house but now with technology you can do many things in your house .
If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers , tell me , I 'm in !!!
Thank you very much for your letter regarding the prize that I won in your competition .
I 'm not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to suggest including this point in the programme .
I 'm pleased to be able to help you with the international student conference .
I felt a lack of them .
Once students have taken a shower after a hard physical training they come to real life , depending on their levels they have to study , for instance languages which I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because these enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way , students have to manage to speak at least three languages .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing above all on Saturdays when you have finished work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
I know I 'm the " daughter of this techological world " and unluckly I think I could stay without it : it 's rather strange that today there 's already somebody without phone , dishwasher , TV ...
This interactive way of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere , without restrictions .
The show was supposed to have started at 19 : 30 , but it only started at 20 : 15 , so the public , including me , was forced to wait for forty-five minutes .
I would n't be surprised if something bad happened to me suddenly .
It will be on the 14th and we all want to go .
Second thing , you should open the show on time because if the audience has to wait , they will not feel happy , but I think you know that .
The clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart , not how you are going to the casino for example but nice casual , not with sports shoes or T-shirts .
It will let me get up and close with nature and experience life in the wild .
At last would you tell us which is the best present for him , a compact disk or a book .
First of all , the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel , which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities .
I would like to travel only in July because my boss can not give me a lift for the other months of summer .
I 'm <unk> with reference to your letter .
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accommodation because I have had all the holidays with my parents in luxury hotels before .
First of all in the description of the show , the starring be be Mr DANNY BROOK , and it was n't .
The time had come the who groups had comdined their forces and were ready to strike .
This is a revolution which has changed our daily life .
And I would like to choose my activities , Golf and painting .
I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition .
I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend the time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air .
But I would like to suggest some requests for the festival .
The team of volunteers was a great one , and all of us were willing to help with anything they needed .
I am writing to share with you some feelings I have after watching a musical show which was played at The Circle Theatre last week .
We are all very happy with your programme , especially since we like the idea of sightseeing by our National Art Gallery .
I have n't heard from you for a long time . How are you ?
Another significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances .
Going shopping is a good thing when you do n't know what to do but it also has many similarities .
The last thing is the theatre restaurant was closed after the show , because it only opened until 9 o'clock at night .
In my opinion , we can have a great time there , and entrence is free of charge for students , which is very important as well .
Another disappointing thing was that discounts were not available , which made me a bit angry .
Singing is the most popular hobby for us .
I can send e-mails or use a mobile phone .
I think that all these problems could have been avoided and that asking my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
In my opinion the hall of the rock concets was too small , you have to consider making a big one for next year because these kinds of events are by by a lot of young people .
I 've never been to the USA before .
At that time , he was unconcious ; I kept asking myself , " Should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first aid skill to deal with him ? "
The evening was a disaster , and I wonder if I have not the right to ask you for returning my money , as I think it is fair .
I 'm asking you for my money back , you can do it , ca n't you ?
At the end of the exam session , all students and teachers meet together for a big party to celebrate it .
It was a bit boring , but it was part of my job .
I 'd like to play gold and tennis . I have both since I was young , and I like them , but I do n't have enough time to play , and my level is n't as good as I 'd like .
It did n't go on as I had expected , and I was really let down when it finished .
So please , it would be fair if you gave me my money back .
It is a revolution in fashion that is starting now .
It started from got up in the morning . We had the machine help us to cook , iron , cleanning , and washing , and then we went out to work . There were cars and sky trains to travel for help us convenience and quickly .
I did n't play tennis before , so I was not good .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
As you already know , I am trying to become a professional photographer , consequently I would choose photograpy as the first activity and painting as the second .
Can we get there by public transport ?
Concerning the information you want , I will give them .
Today a recived your letter . It is the most wonderful news I have here in a long time .
I had to take care that every artist went in the right dressing room and not in someone else .
Carrying big speakers ' place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laughter .
First of all , I would like to say that it was the worst performance I had ever seen and it disappointed me very much .
I was very thrilled when I knew that I won first prize in your competition .
According to your letter I have two options for accommodation , or in tents or log cabins .
Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for the good programme which provides us with 3 days ' stay in London .
I 'm writing to complain about the show that I have recently attended at your theatre .
Endless imagination and development of technology will lead us to future fashion .
It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and everywhere , even if we are two thousand kilometres away from each other .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions , of the new hairstyles , of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to make up .
Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets , and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects .
Please , send me any information about what I should take with me .
They signed my diary and took a photo with me .
This report provides information about Kyong Palace Palace , which is highly recommended to visit visitors from foreign countries .
During my prior holiday in London I came across an advertisement for the show and decided to see it .
I 'm writing to you to complain about a three-day programme .
I have heard from you recently and I 'm really happy . I hope you and your family are well .
But if you do n't like children and are not enough to work as a waiter you may choose a more pieceful job at home .
Are some parties organized during the holidays ?
I was very disappointed with the performance and apart from that there were many problems .
We can see this problem from two different points of view .
I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition .
Since then , I have lived in Area 57 , and this is my diary life .
She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree .
I know you want to learn what I did and how I helped people at the pop concert last month .
Shopping is concerned that people exchange money for their needs .
It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment .
I would like to see the change in an advantage and a disadvantage view , in an advantage . Modern technology is developing toward convenience for humans .
I wonder if I can take them , as well .
New fabrics create new ingredients , all kinds of accesories are added to create new versions , to refresh old ideas , and to make new proposals that will last , like always , just for some weeks .
In your advertisement you informed us about their false existence .
I look forward to hearing from you .
More and more retailors are opening to customers .
When we finished clearing , some of us offered our help to enter the sound equipment at the stadium .
After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but could n't find their seats .
I had to bring them refreshments .
I remember when I had the fare lesson in the Univerty and the ticher took as to the Computer Center and I sow these machins all my College and mine were lofing was very dificul how how you can work in these Kan of Computer .
After a break , the bank had to go to the concert for another one hour and a half .
Secondly , I would like to tell you more about the end-of-conference party .
Maybe I will tell you in the next letter !
In my opinion , shopping brings me a lot of satisfaction , especially when I am depressed . Nevertheless , it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
AS YOU CAN SEE IT WASN'T A " PERFECT <unk> " .
In Japan , I often play Golf but as you know Japanese weather conditions are not enough enjoying play <unk> but California has good weather which is every day sunshuin , . .
In what conditions will it be spent on ?
I had absolutely no choice .
We have to remember that they need a private life like us .
To begin with , it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house .
I think it is also important to present a comercial English lesson , maybe the pupils could write " offers and orders " or enquiries on the blackboard .
Unfourtunately , it is not so cheap .
MY ADRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE .
SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS , SO MY QUALIFICATIONS WERE GOING TO BE VERY <unk> .
The location of the party is n't fixed yet , but we will let you know after your arrival .
This is why the poor died .
It looked like a floating potato , a brown potato ,
Will I be going out much or just staying in Camp California all the time ?
Shops are not for spending our lives in them .
I am writing to reply to your letter saying that I have won the competition , which I ca n't believe .
I was happy to write a letter to you .
I was n't sure of what to do , and the pressure of everyone watching me was driving me mad .
At the end of the conference we are having a party with some cold goods and some drinks .
In conclusion , in my opinion , there are many advantages to my daily life at present and I would recommend people learn computers and would like to say " Enjoy your lives " .
I still go to school and I plan to go to college next year .
Besides , she told me that you are very keen to know how my experience was , so I 'll give you some information in this letter that I 'm sure you will be glad , even if you have not been to the concert .
I think the media must be more understanding .
This lesson will give us to be relaxed and laugh .
They know that if I go out in the car , I will not drink .
Obviously Ted should have known nothing about it and we remembered Pat twice : " The party is a secret !! " and she said : " Yes , it must be a surprise ! "
Thank you very much for granting me the first prize - Camping in California .
It started five minutes later .
I was struggling because I knew if I did n't help him , he would die in a short time .
I am writing to reply to your questions .
So , I look forward to hearing from you soon .
It feels much better .
We will see people differently , with more calm , because we have no stress , and we are not in a hurry to do something else .
I 'm including my ticket and this list of complaints is the reason for returning some money .
Everyone will not walk on the roads .
And your last phrasal of the advertisement " Your perfect evening out " ! It was n't at all , like I have explained to you above in this letter .
Of if we go to hear a classic concert near the conference buildings ?
What we suggest is to change the programme on the afternoon of March the 14th .
It is like they lose their concience while they are shopping .
After cocktail , the Band " Zero one " is playing its famous songs .
Normally I really enjoy shopping .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
Changes wo n't stop ; it 's caming WAP technology ( you 'll buy a cake in a corner machine without any coin , only one call ) , digital TV , virtual reality and more ...
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable .
From my point of view , modern technology has first permitted me to find a job as I work as a computer engineer .
Actually my job was not really stressful , but I had contact and access to all the famous pop stars .
In this world , where the nations fight to be the better one could n't be considered : the airplane became the most important thing in the war .
Finally , I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement said and that we all wished turned out to be a regret for the wasted money .
Nowadays most people are by by shopping centres , which is not always enjoyable .
I could get her as well as simmer for a second or two then she suddenly shouted uncontrollably : " Never have I met such a poor cow as Pat " , hurled at at me , through the phone .
When the show finished I was ready to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed .
Second , how much money do I need ?
What is more , it was their own choice to become popular and well-known .
That was n't difficult because everybody wanted to go .
I look forward to an answer from you .
I think you should do some next year .
We had walked for three hours ( my mother , my two brother and I ) through the humid and noisy jungle , looking forward to reaching a small but clean house where a nice and friendly family , old friends of ours , used to live .
This produced a stunning effect during the concert .
Lastly , what could you possibly do while you will be waiting for three hours for some people who want to go shopping ?
I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes .
I usually stay in a tent during camping . Actually , I do n't like tents so much .
I mean most of the homes are going to be in a building like a flat .
I 'd like to practise golf and tennis .
So I think that the future home could be considered these points .
I am playing tennis very much .
Here in Brazil the rules at school depend on the school .
Thoug , a few of us would like to consider the " London fashion and leisure show " .
I was already happy to help at such a big concert as the Mylene Farmer 's concert .
While we were organizing the concert , she sang on stage .
I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several days to the walls .
A serious theatre ca n't miss such an important thing : the starting-time .
Television has affected " all days life , " too .
Would $ 200 be enough ?
INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES !
The computer has done a lot of work easily .
The aim of this report is to compare the results of the survey , which is about making a short video .
If not , let me know .
I was very happy , what else can I write ?
So did he finally win or lose ?
In my last letter I promised to write to you about my experience working at <unk> .
Between the tent and log cabin , I think that I would prefer a tent .
Jane and Brian were very happy .
or ask you for too much .
Could you believe my luck ?
I fell in love with a beautiful girl , " Calen " . She is from Spain and was selling " hot dogs " .
It has been quite a long time since I last wrote to you .
Computers that make some little things for us nowadays , but at the speed at tecnology goes in the next century those clothes will tell our doctors our healt at any moment , anytime , anywhere , people will be able to locate us arround the world .
Secondly , I 'd like to prefer to stay in tents , which would be the first chance for me to sleep on the outskirts of California .
I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be better , I booked the ticket imagetly .
Last of all , thanks for your consideration about bringing me a present .
I look forward to hearing from you .
They went into the house through a window .
I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing .
