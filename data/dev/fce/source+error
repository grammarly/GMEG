At first , there are now a lot of things that most people uses at home . For , : example a fridge , a cooker or just an electricity .
Anna prepared the cake , Peter organized the music , Heather and I went to buy the present ; Pat said : " OK I 'll phone to some Ted 's friends to invite them " .
I have received just your letter .
So many happy people in , the crowds , that the atmosphere was infectious .
But the form and the rooms , of building a will still be the same .
I think first of all we should film an english lesson , where pupils could preparing some group work or information-boards ' .
If you would ask me , my prefer my friends to do all shoping for me . Because I aware of big lines to check point , ? crowds of people , noise ...
I would like to do singing , and swimming .
Thank you a lot for yours kind letter .
I used .
Thank for you your letter . ; !
But all after the party was great .
I like would do climbing and sailing while I 'm at camp the , I can climbing very well I used to climbing ten years ago in my country .
It was relly pity because I expected to see artists from France , and Italy .
I could may not call my friends from an other city and just say say " hello " .
In mine , we did n't many have rules .
It highlights the background history and considers the interest of young peoples , and a final recommendation .
How have your been ?
At the present day , for ecsample , a lot of people have a personal computer at home , and a very big part of that have also internet , the new frontier of computers , evolution .
Will we need any special clothes and How much you would suggest me to for carry these two weeks ?
I liked that , especially .
It might mean waking up early but its will , be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip .
I was .
First of all because , of the big variety in the store . Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from , not , we have to out choose of twenty or thirty such as Nike , adidas or Fila .
The horrible thing about this , is I 'm still in heaven , but out with the wrong person , because Pat mixed the persons with their names .
Sometime I stay alone all the day but , I have contacts with many people .
There two Carlas in class my !
This , evening as you can , proved to be far from perfect .
In response to your question and if you do n't mind mind , I would prefer to travel in July because I 've already chosen my holiday and my boss wo n't give me another one .
Photography is , quite interesting for me to take a photograph in place the where I have never been to .
I understood everything he said and Sting said , to me that I spoken very well English .
My can find out some information at home , although I do not go to library .
I used to tennis when I was university student .
I went home that day after having told Pat my least deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart .
Firstly , I could to pass this weeks two during next July only , because , before and after it , I have to working as a waiter here in my town .
I am writing , and also about the servic .
I 've had so much work at school recently ( exams ! ) and so many things to do , that I 've , almost forgotten how good is it to relax and rest a bit .
rules the at home are very different .
.
I am very because indignatged I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I , would like you return my money and take notes of all these problems .
Thank you , for giving me these great opportunity .
It is not allways easy , but there are rules in each home and you have to respect them .
I say must that was a great fun , I I 've never had this kind of experience before .
I was , dangerous but I knew had to do it .
I , look forward to meeting your on the conference .
In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer , but , by parents themselves .
Owing to all of them , I .
Some problems of organisation seem to is appeared .
We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs , all what us have to do is watching .
Regarding the , accommodation I , would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep and they are n't very cozy .
Another simple example is my mobile telephone ; A few years ago , I had to buy a telephone card and then to find a telephone box to my parents and to tell them that I would be late for dinner , or other stuff like that .
Computer might know better than human ; but there are many things which it can not replace in our life .
I I 'll leave it to , you .
But so , I think it was for the best , he was also in love me with .
Can I change , moneys on the campus ?
I am looking to the hear new from yours group .
I send just an e-mail and that all is !
The following year , when the bird returned his house house , he gave him a message .
I , am looking to hear from you .
Another example , , the internet .
At home completely different , my is mum quite organised , so she always puts new rules .
There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and reports , themselves or just not having a computer .
Obviously , Pat first refused , but then , she accepted that she was wrong , and apologyse Maria , after then , Pat never again talked about someone within his or her permission .
Third , I painting and golf as activities . ,
Had i a very disappointing evening .
Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors .?
So my , art teacher came to me and my best friend , who is really good at art too , and asked whether I can be able and willing to help for the concert in two weeks time in the concert hall .
This made me get bored bored .
In the present present , the teachnology is a past of life .
After a little I minutes heard steps near my kitchen 's window .
money how much should I bring .
In the next few years the people 's , home will be changes a lot .
Additionally I felt very hungry and uncomfortable because your theatre restaurant was closed and you did not give we any reason why .
Activities connected with the social programme such as internationally evenings , sing along parties and indoor games .
When I , arrived its was closed .
After the , conference , at about 8 pm . a party is organised .
My !
Also I enjoy walking and photography photography .
It , was really a wonderful day .
In this moment Pat wished that she never would have been keen on secrets !
But this was also the , moment when my nightmare started to come alive .
We were thinking .!
Therefore , if you to want learn something about the Olympic Games , it must be the best place for this .
He had a puncture wheel and he did n't know how to repeared then I chanced the wheel and during this time he was asking me for my hobbies , studies , : everything .
My second was to take the money at the bars and to bring them in a little room where I could see the pop star walked in the corridor . ; ; ; ; ;
What I can do without mine music and my computer . ; ; ; ; ;
The show can , be seen between 10.00 - 19.00 .
You could hire to other , do the work .
I am writing to giving information about myself myself .
But computers do n't have affected only in a good way because thank you to the computers number the places of work for the is persons minor .
Fathermore I would like : to ask you which kind clothes I need to take and how much moneys I 'll spend .
Next to the restaurant , there a is disco for people who like dancing .
I saw all the pop bands and singers singers .
Do you reccomend , me to take only summer clothes or , some winter clothes as well ?
We are foraward to hearing from you .
I will be looking forward to .
Advertisement the says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and , hairstyles etc .
It is true that science and technology .
I never forget importantly days . Becouse I have got a data-bank data-bank .
Moreover , I have been thinking about changing the location because , as you probably already know , some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody who wanted in go .
In other hand , after shopping you 'll get tired and maybe , you ca n't afford your credit card .!
It is a great fault of responsability for a theatre like yours to have a delay like one this .
The before concert actually , started I had to give out lots of leaflets , they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds .
He accepted and we left him free free .
An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway 's work and what he by meant " pace under pressure " .
Looking to your letter , I can see many options of activities and I was realizing that I like most , of them .
It is very fantastic especially the programme on 13th March that we are having a river trip Greenwich to .
This will be in the Casino Hotel and we do n't need to worry for the best way because in all the main routes in , Devonport .

If we came back to the past , we , felt everything , it was so difficult to do , we would have plane and done by ourself and last time .
As all the travel expenses are paid already , I would appreciate it if you could tell what , kind of clothing also how much pocket money , I need .
Famous people diserve also to have , a private life .
Thirdly , when I bought the tickets , I asked for discounts and nobody know anything about them , so it is false are there , discounts available .
We know an all what shopping is .
When I done that , was i traveling around Japan .
On the next day I helped them to the scenary and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening .
I am writing to answer about your invitation I which have receved as an first winner .
Then again in a few minutes the weathers changed and strong storm begun .
The price ticket of was another problem .
Ernest Hemingway 's sentences are precise , but still , very powerful and alive .
My forward look to hearing from you in the near future .
I would prefer an accomodation in log cabins because I is not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
I look forward to receiving your letter. :
Could you something do for these problems ?
I will not be able to travel , on August because I found a job for that month .
But the best place for me is " La , Vaguada " . An entertainment and commercial , building building .
And of'course , not all shops have good conditionering .
I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part of " Camp in california the USA " .
In my opinion , this is still correctly .
I when think of " the Home of the Future " . I want , to have a home which is built with a new material material .
Location : The castle , is in the city centre nearby an enormous church .
I .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .!
Nowdays motorization is one the of most , important inventions .
We have invite the student , the teachers and the Principal of school but we .
You can open close and the windows and switch the light on and off .
Also I would like to do two activities while I am at Camp the which are swimming and photography .
The party going to be in a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is walking .
A new technology and science will change fabrics , so they change will their colour during the day .
I have a friend and she knows that I speak English so she offered to me work with an English singer so I " said yes , of , course " .
Unfortunately it 's not possible unless your can rest in the morning .
We have n't asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes , although you can , come well-dressed , if you feel better .
After the horrible act of your star , it .
I used to write letters ' but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappear so E-mail is brilliant for my life .
The two activity that I would like to do at the Camp are sailing , which I have never done before and tennis which I already play quite well .
I have been a full time student in the university at home , and their classes all requires us to have personal computer and use them at times any .
The first thing I do every day , when I get up , is to prepare cappuccino fantastic with my coffe machine .
Photography is a , very interesting activitie , and is not too hard to do too .
Job the came unexpectedly as my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event .
There are ways of behaviour to .
It , .
While we were installing the sound system we listened irish music ; and suddenly we saw to U2 , which is my favourite group , going inside the stadium and they played music for us .
I did n't tell you , but I helped , in this concert just by a chance .
Suddenly Pat .
Of part the show can be filmed filmed .
Shopping , is not always enjoyable enjoyable .
They .
The opening time starts from 7.30 , AM. till late at night when the theatre is closed .
Me and my friends were very excited , not because of , the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we will be able to see !
You must have TV because you can liten what it happend the in world and you can watch some places that you did n't go .
My done mace-up for them .
An accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is , in log cabins . ,
At the just moment I went just to one concert .
I really enjoyed to be next to the pop stars I got a lot of autographes , that was the first time I 've seen like Jagger a lot of , well know pop stars was there .
I had to helped back stages .
Unfortunately , Pat .
It was supposed to starts at half past seven , and it only started at fifteen past eight .
Canned you think you have every information you need whenever you want ?
If you do n't have problems we attend yours , we good hope answer .
The fact were that Pat choose to go to the year 2000 , and when he arrived , he told every one that he was the inventor .
They keep. :
But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries , not stars from around the as world you announce in your advertisement .
It is possible that only one computer will do this all and it will have its own personality , ; ; ; ; ; voice , eyesight. .
Nevertheless , stayed i since I had paid .
All the waiting made me quite hungry ; so I was expecting to have good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show .
Second , the concert halls .
By contrast , In the future , I guess we would rather back to the acient time , owing to , have natural life style .
This is one other important to thing remember .
On the other , hand people will , still be living in a building which is constructed for a " family " .
Us would , have much money from the work .
I look , forward to reading you from .
If yes yes , wait until 2100s !
Try to ask who .
Thank you for being the organised programme for our class , I think you may think about a long time that how shall we study during three days .
What is exactly what happens to me .
That has been my dream since my childhoods .
There was no solutions ' to finally .
You 'll have happily memories and an good mood .
It will be a great opportunity for me , to see the United States and I am so happy about that , I can not explain it .
I looked out through the window and saws a big strange " thing " .
And of course immediately i told Yes !!
I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died in the car crash was one , of the most disarster examples .
Felt i how luck I was .
Firstly , I was really , looking forward to Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage .
Speaking , class should be filmed .
First of all , I do n't like and do n't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley ( which , by the way , has it 's own idea of where it want 're to go ) between other desperate people baskets , just to find that perfect tin of beans or a toothpaste . Especially that it is so hard to find anything in a modern , huge and stuffed with lots merchandise of department stores .
The concerts are , fabulous but the problems are the halls .
First , I , would be liking to travel during July . Because my college will finish in the end of June and I am going to go back Japan to August in .
Today , however , people do not to , spend many times on making food , washing up , or even on turning on an off the light .
I unfortunately am not so good in it . ,
Now the only think I have to do is go to computer room and turn on the computer .
Why does you put on the paper then ?
Referent , where the conference is .
Apart from Banks and important offices offices . There are also world stock market exchange , an opera theatre , shopping arcades , books and records stores .?
Is it normally when you are , a star , that everybody wants knew all about you .
I 'm , looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Mean this the engineering will find the way to useless petrol for it , so it must useful in the future .
I was sitting and waiting for forty five minutes the until play started .
2 - They also .
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouthes and noses ' like we have sun-glasses , and that all the masks are designers brands , which are made of special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
Thank , you very much . ; ; ; ; ;
At last you wrote that it was our perfect evening out , but like said i before it was n't .
I though it some was rubbers .
It is the best way to shopping enjoy .
I love travelling when weather the is warm .
Yet my hand phone is in my bag and , I bring it everywhere .
We hope to see , you at the party and have a wonderfull time together .
Is n't it , a big opportunity for us ?
Their have taken a big progress in our every day life and they have always become more important for us .
Nevertheless , sometimes communications disturb lifes their in a wrong way .
I am writing to complain about the musical show " OVER THE RAINBOW " which I saw , in your theatre yesterday .
Firstly I will able be to travel just in , july because my class starts the month after this .
Concerning swimming , I practise these sport once a week myself on , so I am just an amateur , not a great swimmer !
Then I woke up ; well , I shall never know what happened to the " poorly cow " !
From park square , just straight .
Try to give up shopping one day and try to your day with friends going to play something together .
For instance , you want to buy everything , which you saw , and after that , you do n't know how much you have spent .
They are against democracy I , think .
When all the family up get , I told us the true and all promised to say nothing .
Even food polluted .
So their prefer leave their sons wecting TV .
There seems to be a general opinion that sports sports , art and music activities such as tennis , football , orchestra , painting , photography should be included .
One of the reason I went to see that particular show , was the starring actor announced in the add , Danny Brook , but when the show actually started , , with forty five minutes delay , I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play .
The actor ' Danny brook ' , whom you advertised in the brocher , did not , play a part in the show .
Mine name is Volencia Vardez .
I am writing in order to complain about the show " Over the Rainbow " , which was played , in the " Circle Theatre " , because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all .
I loocked outside and two men go into the house in front of mine .
You also mentioned about the discounts and there were not any .
He was really kind and friendly but really what I really most enjoyed of it , was when he invited me this night for a drink in the most luxury pub have i ever been .
I could n't believe , my eyes .
But this times it 'll be different , my thought .
My life would n't be the same another time without these progresss .
I would like to ask whather you have competitions or , different activities ?
they all , exploded with loud splashes .
Then , I want to mark , that concert halls were too small , that is why they overcrowded during some concerts .
Tents remind me of the time when I was the at army - I would prefer log cabin for my stay in the camp .
Then I go to , work , by motorbike .
Before I used computers generally , It took so much time , for me to looking up words in a dictionary and looking up for information .
However , there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert concert .
Thanks you for your attenlion and , understanding .
Firstly , I 'm very glad .
To sum up , there are many disadvantages as well , as advantages .
You , should the avoid peak times .
And I 'd be liking to know about what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too .
It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting , human activities nowadays .
For me my opinions on this one is true it is , boring , it might because I am a boy .
Especially I , liked that time .
HOW have MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I first bought a computer as , I was in university .
They come up with many but ideas it ca n't last for a long time .
Brian learm what was happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked , him .
When I went to buy the ticket I tried to get a discount with , my student card , but that was not posible .
It a 's boring rule . ; ; ; ; ;
I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of its is creation great .
In , what day i can start my travel ?
The first thing that annoyed me were the forty-five , minutes we were waiting for the beginning .
They : me who travels often .
The add also mentioned discounts discounts , but that was n't true either .
On balance , I affirm can that I .
" Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at . " I , was reading when I suddenly hard a big bang .
I am writing to you on , behalf of my class concerning our trip to London .
Recently , the exhibition of africa just finished finished .
The Madrid is a big city and have many interesting places .
Machines , such as a dish washer , laundry machine and remotely controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary .
Am i looking forward to hearing from you .
Using the equipment and area what we have to organise some , activities .
Advertise you that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20 : 15 as it did .
I am well and fast at swimming .
About the activities listed on your letter , I choose , basketball and singing .
All these mean facts that our modern life gives big damage to the earth .
Secondly , you have requires information about the end-of-conference party .
For just one day in my summer holidays I , planned to do something adventurous .
As well as , this , the stars should n't complaint at any time about their fans and their lost of privacy .
I 'm writing to you to complain about , the musical show present at the moment : " Over the Rainbow " .
It suppose to be , my perfect everning out . But it was n't n't .
I really expect that you consider mine arguments and cash me back the value of the ticket , as soon as possible .
Thank you very much for your letter letter. ,
But we should not forget that it 's only and tools emphazise human relationships .
For , example , nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom .
However , we have seen , an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show It would on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00 .
First of all , modern technology have changed my life daily the last five years more quickly than in the anchient time , or even than a ten years ago .
I find shopping .
First of all , using computer is the most important for me because I can store my personal records such as diary or expenses ' and send i E-mail to my friends who live abroad .
I had to , pay the full prize for them which , was quite expencive .
Something was telling that me I was going to lose a , friend and a love .
One of the most interesting ones " . A story of an old seaman leaving his town to , proove that he still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught .
Although the show , it started at 20=15 , so I had to wait for an hour .
Bromley town , center , is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London .
Why did your write that they were available ?
Finally , thank you again for everything and I am looking to forward accompanying you soon .
This again enables people to time save .
I am , keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives however I dislike the , idea that such a science might fall or had already fallen in wicked hands .
In my opinion there 's nothing special that I , maybe only this , that I would n't .
I , would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize , I have won .
Instead , there was unknown this actor with a very bad performance and a terrible annoying voice .
I I 'd like to know some examples .
I bought a ticket for the 19.30 round and the shows was very very late .
You been presented some causes why shopping not always enjoyable .
But in the winter there 's , still a problem which is to solve .
I suppose it will be better for your theatre 's reputation to at give least some of my money back .
I have choosen golf because I have never played in , this game .
I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant , but because of the late start of the show , the restaurant was closed the by end of the show .
They are the also lessons which are particularlly curious in .
I 'm so happy and exciting to receive , this letter about I 've won the first prize in your competition .
About the accommodation , I 'd prefer to in stay log cabins , because for me and my family 's more comfortable .
For works that you needed , for example three hours you can does them in ten minutes ; the same !
It is called Penrhyh Castle , as the will building tell all you about Wales .
My family decide to visit my grandmother in Orlando , because she got some problems with the swiming-pool she , ask my parents to help her in a new swiming pool building .
I also helped in lighting the and studio equipment .
I is a fun of Danny Brook so when I read in the advertisement his name I immediately decided to go to the , show .
My professor , said ' go and get familier with , your computer , otherwise you 'll fail ' .
As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I like it and get quite good marks for my project , ; about light and sound .
He was very kind to me , we talked , many things and after the concert he invited all the team to have a dinner , yes I know what you 're thinking , " Dinner and Sting " yes my friend it was the best thing in my life .
It 's like , , walking in , the clouds , , you feel like flaing .
Additionally , I can visit the threatre restaurant after the show . ;
After all this introduction , will be the time to show some of the every acitivities one can join in the school , such as lesons or others like the library , our protagonist having a cofe with some coleagues in the cofe bar , the reception service ..
These are the , my suggestions .
But from the other , everybody has the right to have an secret garden , the right to be with his / her family without be disturbed by journalists and photographers .
According to my job , I had to help the teams with the outlights and of course it had been my first proffesional experience : at the end I felt a member of them , because they were so kind to me , and I could colaborated a lot of and , I learnt a lot with this project .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisment about a , fashion and leisure show in London .
The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was , performed to and have everything in order so the concert could be a succes , which it was .
We shoud could n't forget , that for this the reason stars want to keep their private life away from the media !
I am writing to complaint about a very disappointing evening I , recently had during a week 's holiday in London .
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected , the way of life of people from industrial countries .
First of all , you 've , asked me when , I wanted to travel .
there electric light , has invented .
Which clothes should , take i ?
The conference party last will at 1.00 AM , but every body do not need to stay until the end .
In addition , I suggest that they should wear sporty and comfortably clothes .
Pat sent , to my house a fax with the different alternatives she thought but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she .
On the other hand there is a big problem : ! the mony .
It , was so nice to hear from you last times .
In my view , : it was extremely interesting and satisfing for me all the concert long .
If you think that fifty years ago , when there were n't cars any or sort of comfort ( born just in the " industrial age " ) everything had to be done by hands or by animal work : I think in that time life was really harder than now !
I was very happy to receive letter your .
After all I am sure that you understood it was n't my perfect evening out and you will give mine money back .
During my visit there occurred some problems , that made my evening , completely disappointing .
For example , without using I internet could not put me through to foreign , people .
Benoni 's school is a school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels , Belgium .
and last the , last one . How much money i , should take there ?
As I understand is very imortant to confirmed the date of travelling .
I look forward to hearing from you .!
BUT WHAT CAN NOT I FORGIVE TO YOUR COMPANY IS TO CHANGE THE START AT THE LAST MOMENT , MY HUSBAND IS A , DANNY BROOK 'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISSAPOINTED .
IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED , SOME CASS , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
I booked Palace Hotel 's restaurant for our party and it is big , enough for your students .
Finally Finally , could you let me know how the weather is like in July in States ?
The computer helpfull is when I want to contact somebody very fast .
Therefore , I am interestedly in staying a log cabin .
I can wash any clothes there ?
Painting is something that I love and my am very good doing it .
I used and I like to paint the composition .
Please do not hesitate contact me at 0297 ( ) 8245123 in case of need .
I hope I could give you a some ideas .
In my opinion a guided tour is essential , because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of uniquely works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions .
The cafe in the is hotel available .
We arrived at stadium the the previous evening .
How has modern technology changed your daily , life .
Really he was , bad .
Also , I belonged to golf club I when went , to university in Japan .
With a computer however , all this is done , in the matter of seconds .
I did n't say anything and , let her go on grieving over herself .
However , people noticed that what is important is not clothes their but their mind .
First of all , I would like to travel on July because I will I have finished my exams by the end of June .
My daily life is , changing .!
I suggest a refund of the , full price and I hope you are willing to take your responsibilities .
I think that people will be as alone and julous as , today .
I 'd like to ask you about how much money I 'll need for two weeks in your country what and sort of clothes I have to bring to Camp California next july .
Finally , I would be grateful to you , if , you told me about clothes and money .
Will there be music as well for dancing .
Because last time was i in a tent , I found it really uncomfortable and when it I could n't got to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent .
In my opinion the modern technology has changed my daily life not really a lot because , I am just 20 years old and I used to play computer when I was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine .
In addition to this I , wish I am going to sail : I have never try it , but it seems to be great !
I can send a mail to my friend who lives in Canada. ,
I 'm a very out door person , who like to go camping and hiking , so staying in a tents is like a , second home to me .
Linking to the , internet was so popular .
Last week I recived your letter in wich you told me that I won more first prize .
Then the show was suppost to start at 19.30 hours but it at 20 : 15 , more than half an hour later .
It also held an exhibition internation all year round .
This is show about latest fashions leisure , and sports wear , make up and Hairstyles .
Although it is not comfortable very , my like camping very much .
Finally and , ; ; ; ; ; your restaurant was not available after the show .
Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their life have been far easier than , before .
For the first activity , I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but I that have very few experience in it .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria for him , in fact , she was so angry she almost kill but , she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
I so excited by the , news .
I recorded a demo tape , which I can send to you if you will , in which I also play the guitar .
How has modern technology changed your , daily life ?
HOW ?
I in was her room and helping her .
Modern technology has completly changed my daily life , which more comfortable , and easier .
So , that , we decide , to access our school Main database change and our test results .
For the handicapped , going shopping is not easy and it , can be very bothering unless shops have facilities for them .
All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed book a band as well .
I will .
In August I have work so. ;
People are used to go to the shopping because it is easier and familiare , it is one place where you can lunch or , dinner , watch some movie after that , and if you want buy something at the shops .
Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the , ticket , which cost me £20 .
And we have two choices to get to the conference , an bus or a train .
As I to came London on holidays and purchased " The London City Guide " I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance .
I to .
It was , month last that I was selected .
It means Japanese is planning for the future home .
But definetely , they has , been a very important invention .
Second I , prefer to stay a log cabin .
Secondly , despite of yours advertisement of the possibility of discounts , when I showed my student identity card to one of your employes she angrily told me that I had to pay the whole prize .
I would be if glad you consider mine suggestions .
I wase n't expecting this prize because .
Is it the first step for a true fraternity .
That exciting stories always , describe people in difficult situations is true of Agatha Christie 's " Witness for the prosecution " .
Therefore , I would like to ask you for refunding me my entrance fee , as this evening not correspond to your advertisement .
We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that especially because we will have the possibility to the Science Museum and the National Gallery .
You thank for your letter .
However , we have to consider about our nature human-being and. ,
You wrote an advertisment that people from more than 15 deferent countries were going to visit this concert , there but were artists only from 6 countries .
ENGLISH the : classroom is beautifull , and in the same day we , do a lot of diferents activities , so it wo n't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there .
I am allowed to do what want as long as I studie enough to aprove .
Please .
I writing to inform you about your question .
Thing another the started time , the show started forty five minutes late .
It located in the city and the tube nearest is station Moorgate Station .
This has been scheduled 3 months , ago .?
Before go on holiday I use internet to book or get details from travel agency , which means I could save my time and physical energy .
My have never done light and sound for the real pop concert before and I think it will be a good experience for me .
I had to help the director writing a script of the concert and , design the background of the stage .
You will be able to there get either by bus ( no 150 ) or on foot .
You can enjoy you time to watch a film if you have free times .
From there to the conference you have to take the bus number 50 , that near stop the hotel and arrive in town center .
It was really disappointing disappointing !
As I have not been there before , I am rather unsure of what to wear. :
Some , people will do crazy things in situation like this .?
And then , when I arrived at the theatre expected i to have a discount but unfortunatly I did n't .
Then we had an , idea !
How has the phone affected my own , life ?
My favourite sports climbing and surfing , I 'm very good at climbings but for surfing I need some practise .
On the last day , we have arranged a small party in the hotel , then we all set up to had a sightseeing Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for airport .
People buy and buy unnecessary things but , when arrives they in their houses , they can see an empty wallet .
How , modern technology changed your daily life ?
Please write back or call me if there is any more , information you need .
When you are tired after looking around you might want to drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical thing , migh you as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
It seemed to be the most interesting lesson , because student always make some mistake while they are practising with thier partner , in spite , of having told from teacher ten times .
I was so disappointed that was i thinking of leaving your theatre .
Looking , forward to hearing from you .
People must get some rest often , and as a result they look forward some happiness at the free such time as , party , games , and every one loves party , it should have been filmed .
That time I the magic of world computers .
I , was able to some have signatures of them .
I think , all of these disappointments is too much for one evening .
I think that my parents let me do what I want , because they trust , me .
There willed be a bus taking students who do not need to stay at the party until the end .
The main is the ozone hole that affect all the people in the world .
Secondly , my choise is the accommodation in tents , I think its could be more interesting , I could enjoy my time with other people playing , eating and talking outside , in my opinion if I choose the log cabins it will be like be at home .
For example , the advertisement said we could buy tickets ' with discounts , but I when went to buy it your employees told me there were no discounts available .
I am good at and swimming playing tennis .
I ca n't , imagine real holidays without a tent .
Some of them natural are whereas the others are not .
Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it it .
Journalists should not follow them all the time , trying to make an , interview or taking an ' interesting ' picture .
But Ivan was so kind person that he let Gold Fish went without condition any .
So , the rules are clear , you need to participate to the lessons and also be successful at the exam of June 2000 .
We also would .
We did , not have " a perfect evening " as it was written , actually we had an evening full of the theatre 's mistakes and were extremely disappointed .
I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for , 2 months at that time .
We to order taxis for them as they did n't have mobile telephones .
The date is Tuesday March 14. !
I 'd love to hear all your news , why do n't you are come and visit me ?
But , it 's not easy for workers , because the shops their close doors about 5.30 pm ( half past five ) .
The party will . The Hotel , Hall .
I would be preferring in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me .
A being security guard was the , hardest task .
They had invited us ; and we wanted them to seen us stunningly beautiful .
So I am going to ask for an refund ...
This , and at the same time saved some trees ' in a rainforest from being cut .
They , nead to be with their family in silence .
Do you think travel chaque would be more secure .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from your very , very soon .
I have a , baby and three dogs , so it should be better in log cabins .?
I would like to know about how many peopl will stay , with me into the tent , and have a take with me special clothes for doing serf .
Of , course , our life will be completely changed .
As you know I 'm in Ferndown now last minutes studying for exams .
I 'm rather trained in climbing , I have done it once a mounth since I 17 was .
Well that 's all now for and I hope to from hear you soon .
I do n't now when I and , going to be free , for going to my planet .
AT seven o'clock on the we dot went there for starting queueing .
Seeing that this is the first year of the drama lessons ' , it is not very well known .
I am writing to your inconnection with your programme of spending three days in London .
we do n't that think there is less of a hundred years , nothing of that existed .
As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and that can tell or teach us .
All syntetic will material uncomfortable for these people .
I am looking forward to you soon .
In our class , we do n't have problem with students who dislike , because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say there years and years .
There are many interesting , works of art by famous painters of this country .
The conference starts at 5 , o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm .
I never stayed in tents in the middle of nowhere , in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and , new .
Then I 15 was years old .
Conclusion : I gave you a lot of reason to get in this building and I hope , you will enjoy your trip in my town .
It started already and do n't have limites to go . ;
How 's amazingly that ?!
Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones , like the promotion paper said they made discounts to people , that worked at the British , Institute .
It will at be Central Exhibition Hall , London .
Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for working some , inside .
First of all , the name of hotel which we have been booked into is Palace Hotel . :
I hope you , well .
b ) ; basketball and football games .
I really forward look to it because I .
I look forward to hearing from you you .
My have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit .
If give the no money back , I will go to the newspaper .
May be there , are some occasions which I have to pay myself .
I , helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much .
I hope you can imagine great my disappointment .
Your do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very cassual .
Firstly people are able to talks to person every on time . Be : it just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins .
My believe that everyone in this world have curiosity .
It was said that stars and artists from around the world on the advertisement , in but fact they are from only six different countries , so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year .
I suggest to organize next IAF in summer the .
In addition to these , I can contact to anyone who I want to talk at any convenient time in case I need him or her , I or am needed .
I , your latter .
It is also free to enter for students . :
FIRST AND FOREMOST , IT 'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS , EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST WAYS OF TRANSPORT .
In Conclusion I 'd like to that recoment you should , first , know what you have to offer and the advertising it .
It was dangerous , but I knew I to do it .
Lots of information in your advertisement are not correct . ; ; ; ; ;
Secondly , I rather would be accomodationed in log cabins than go in tens .
I to go very often , to look around and to buy some new clothes . As long as I am not searching for something , specific .
I look forward to , you .
Firstly , you said your in advertisement that artists from around the world would perform .
I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school , I but do n't have the enough power .
Of course they , were punished .
With reference , to the last afternoon , if were I you I would visit the City Museum .
That was the most scarely and daring that thing I did in my childhood .
I to had wait for forty five minutes .
But what life is it , when you even ca n't go to a restaurant being the afraid of , the journalists , will be waiting outside for you ?
Moreover , it started at 20.15 , instead of 19.30 as you written on it .
In these days , many kinds , of pollution have been caused by our modern lifes . Air pollution by cars , Soil by pollution industrial wastes .
We have to say that technological searches have taken in our society " their good fruits " but , at the same time , negatively aspects too .
It has .
Maths is the most popular subject in , the school .
For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy , we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATER AND WITH ANY , DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE ENTRY .
YOUR ORGANISATION be A GREAT DISASTER .
I am writing you .
I went to Hampton Court last year , and I think it is a great place to .
Last week some students of our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion , and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March .
Take the 67 route and it will take , you just in front of The Royal Hall .
I am !
There will mixture be of styles from different times of the past , so if you feel like a medieval princess , you can dress like one .
However , they nice very people .
To sum up I enjoy wasting moneys and buying useful things or not .
The concert was really absolute marvellous !
We do n't has to learn their every second .
The conference is organised in the hall civic so it , is very simple to found it .
Unfortunalety my feelings is rather badly .
Most student who were interviewed suggested to have a speaking part , of the lesson to be on film .
Other members of groups can wear a normally pretty formal dress .
They are very nice people even Audrey who very stupid .
In Conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it will be too buzy .
My mother tried to a doctor , but they said there was no one .
Foremost , after finishing my work , I could meet singers ' by chance !!
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the that programme you provided .
Finally , I was wanting to know if I need money how and many , and if there is a dry cleaning .
If I had choice a , I would prefer to live in tent then in a log cabin .
The is building huge with high technology and construction and a tight security .
If I 'm not lucky , enough to find one , then I 'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping places such as London .
Everything has been finally planed days two before the concert .
As part a of this , the leader of each group has to wear a costume of her country .
I 'm very surprised about the well news and I 'm sure I 'll really have a good time in California .
The show 's date is very convinient - March 14 - , and it is on Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be problem a to get there .
I 'm writting you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I .
It was so , fun that I enjoyed it a lot .
First of all I would like to say , that I very am happy that I won first prize in your competition .
Particularly I am pleased to had know the most popularly pop stars in the world .
Also Iternet , has influence on my daily life , beause I can find there many interesting things , or I can meet with people from all over the world which is exciting for me .
Secondly , the show should began at past half seven . ; despite these fact the show begun at a quarter to , eight .
Just looking around , I realise that modern technology has crept , into every area of my life .
Your visit to the shop conludes in a long queue to the checkout ( where you can easily spend another 30 minutes ) where they will suck out some money from your account account .
Concerning the proposed activities please please , accept me for Singing and Painting .
My fellow students and I know that your husband , has his birthday on Tuesday the 16th of June and we would like to organise a party for him .
But I would take the opportunity to myself .
My have not , expect it .
I would be glad to be ably to you .
I you will listen my suggestions .
But you thought about what kind of clothes we will wear 100 years from now ?
If you are going shopping , someone can easily steal your wallet which you are looking at some interesting things .
How the did beast knew his name name ?
The case of the , Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities .
Three years , ago when I was in Japan , my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time I get back from the school .
IT WAS , COMPLETELY WRONG !
The things started happening from first the day we arrived .
What are more , some concert halls were , too small .
I not do know if it is possible to make any change in this plan but we saw an ad in " Time Out " magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see .
I 'm looking forward to hear from you .?
Generally , we , supposed to treat our parents ( as well as the teachers at school ) with respect and not to argue with our brothers and sisters .
In the evening I got a flat tire , and because of this I got late to the show show , when I got to my place , it was used ( it cost a lot ) and they took me to the cheapest seats , where I could n't see a thing .
It is worth visiting exhibition and we would like go there .
On the contrary it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities . :
I am writing to you becaus I was very disappointing with the presentation you have made to attract people to come to , your theatre .
I am writting this letter informe to you about the decisions I have made according to your questions .
I am writing , this letter to complane about the , Circle Theatre .
Owing to increasing , demand of light for more activities , the natural source is not adequate .
I am writting you for complaining about the lastly saturday evening performance in your theatre .
What my life most is portal computers .
Walking on a city street , it 's difficult to find parks or " green " places with trees and clean , air : actually pollution , traffic and noize are the main problems of our society .
I . However , it .
It 're seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking though the river .
They just look , funny !
And about what , about mobile telephones ?
It , has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautifull country .
FIRSTLY I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE ON , THE BROCHURE .
I have no idea from to where start .
Another actor took his place place .
So you , can help them and earn quiete enough .
Swimming are quite nice activity to relax and work out .
First of all , I would , like to say that the only month available from me to travel is July .
And then , you may save money for the things you like , nothing to , do , just for the poor things what you like so funny is n't it ?
When Alexander Graham Bell first , invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
Firstly , I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity enjoy different arts events .
Anyway , as students we do n't , have much money to spend on shopping and the good thing is that it wo n't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees free are for students .
Another important lesson to film is " culture and civilization civilization , therefore people will know that the hostessess prepered at this school are not only , ? as French say , " pot-au-fleurs " , beautiful faces to show off but also well read persons .
And we like that , because it 's easier nothing doing than ourselves in something that make us do something .
Then we just can , just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored ready to eat . If we than want to go to work we does n't have to get our horse , no , we get the car keys and go where ever we want to .
When was I a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I am playing at least at the weekend .
When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they .
In opinion my the journalists should have respect more for the private life of the famous people .
And please say me how much money I supposed to need excluding transport and accomodation .
That .
But , instead there was a differently actor , who I never heard about before !
secondly on the article the times were 14 : 30 and 19 : 30 .
I think it would be , better for me to travel on July .
The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit in your theatre where I wanted to see the musical ' over the rainbow ' , after I read the for advertisement the show .
I extremely liked all concerts , shows shows , exhibitions , but why there were n't any photograph exhibitions ?
It started at 20 : 15 that and waisted my time and made me feel bad about your service .
Firstly , I want to say it is a great idea to have , this international arts festival , it is very interesting , especially for the young people ' .
My name Bao-yu Liao .
And we should keep our attention in paid order save our precious earth .
Firstly , I am a fan of Danny Brook so your advert attracted me but when I was gone there a different actor was in the musical show instead of him .
Am i writing , on behalf of the students in my class , to thank you very much for the trip to London .
I also got .
That 's why Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .!
In my daily life , I use the facilities of modern technology very often and it really makes my easier life to live .
I was pleasantly surprised that , , I have won the firstly prize in your competition .
But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all the world and I .
One day Ivan , a fish .
And , last but not least is the fact that famous people ca n't express their emotions , show their real feelings to public .
The developpement of portable communication systems , such as mobile phones has greatly changed our , way of life .
We moreover always can call for help to the police , to the hospital or to a doctor .
But , I do n't think this clothes are going to be a fashion on the earth .
I can take advantage of those technologies like mobile phone , lap top computer , television , to contacts have with different cultures .
I cuold read , in the advertisment that there was some discounts available but there werent .
My name is ... and am i a , student representative .
Sometimes shopping very enjoyable but not everyday .
On the last day we are going to have about three hours , free times .
This was my secret ; and now it was not .
We were really pleased because it was our first time in , England .
This will make , the festival better . We will meet next year in the festival .
Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on that , however I that wish I can learn about it on the Camp .
It 's dificult quite for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot wich are climbing , tennis , surfing and photography , but if I have to make a choise , I choose climbing and surfing .
They are too small for all people the .
A First of all , the actor was not Danny Brook .
It wills be fantastic !
I 'm looking forward to seeing you the on conference .
I have played basketball for six years , and I 've in , competitions for five years .
I think it would be fun to stay in a tent those two weeks , I have never done that before , by my friends ' told me that I would enjoy it .
The evening that I spent there was terrible so please may I have my money , back .
If we do n't , we do n't do politics or movies !
Secondly , when , the show started , I was looking for Danny Brook , because this actor was the most important reason for me to come here .
Since secondarily school I am very interested in taking pictures and I have a big experience in it .
Could it be very enjoyable .
Us ca n't do anything about is .
In 100 years most of the clothes are .
If you not do return my money I will send a letter to a lawyer .
First of all , I was looking forward to see one of my favourite actors , Danny Brook , and it was very disappointing me for to see a diferent actor instead of him in spite of his name was writen in the advertisement .
I 'm also include the show 's leaflet on the back of letter this .
Now I hope that you can understand my question for the some money back because of the trouble I had .
While there I saw your advertisement for the show " Over the rainbow " and decided .
Internet was something amazing for , me .
Log cabins may be more confortable , on the , other hand I think that I will be able to " survive " in tents .
Can how exsiting when we stay in the dark and very quite and we can hear a sound of animal .
The majorite has chosen History , which means a big journey around the world , either at the Roman , life style , or in the midle age , when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands .

It .
I 'm to tell you about my experience last month .
Lots of People wher injured and even more where suspended the next day at school , when the Headmaster found out what had .
However , something wrong come up again .
That fact should respected by , the journalists .
People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary , comfortable feel and stand out .
I would rather , choose July because it is only one month when I have got holiday , long enough to spend it by travelling abroad .
My wife an I spent an couple days of in London two weeks ago .
These experiences influenced him so deeply , that he described his feelings in several books .
In your letter you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in tents or log cabin , and I would like to in sleep a log cabin please .
The discounts were n't available and your theatre restaurant was n't open , because the owners .
The festival was , generally good but I have some suggestions for the next year 's festival .
To begin with , we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians ' , although they sometimes are n't truly .
The company I work , work for Los Svaves , it 's a very famous group from my country .
So I must that insist I want to have full a refund .
I went to London last week for business and loving very much theatre I had promised my friend to " .
To sum up , technology has been a great help to , all us of .
I worked all days , but I did it with , pleasure .
By the time it finished , I was exhausted , but I certainly enjoyed this experience as you can , meet many people at a time and what I liked most was that you can see famous stars very close and listen to their live music for free !
I am a , student of technical a univercity .
The problem only woulds be that my drawing is pretty bad .
One more thing about show is , it 's free students for .
Sometimes , when you shopping on the street , will you see a lot of things that you like , and you ca n't buy it once , you will feel very sad maybe .
After the , conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce each others .
I think , that is an good question to think about .
Please write me a letter as soon , as possible !
We will unwilling be to give a housework away .
The sea is also polluted by oil and chemical detergent which is used at home home .
You are asking me to choose 2 just activities .
I suppose you still wonder what the great can authors do for us . Therefore is hemingway a , very good example .
They had water bombs ' water and pistols at the ready .
My marks was n't good enought to , Science , and the exam session was finished .
During the concert , I did n't have a lot do , so I had chance to most see of the performance , that was excellent .
I could then , her feel , upset as ever .
I used my computer for collecting reports from internet and I can promise I found so much information that I could n't analize its in two weeks .
As a result , it , was impossible for al the audience to fit in there .
What does it like in July over there ? ; ; ; ; ;
But the worst thing comes at , the end .
First of all all , you as also know , lots of technology have boosted since few years .
This is a very central hotel located not far away from , the conference hall .
The boy could not beleive to what his were hearing .
You can see sign the of hotel .
My would be greatful if you could arrange these shows in your programme .
I , WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A COMPLETE REFOUND .
Science and technology , our moder society .
Having money and be able to spend it in anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it in an enjoyable moment . ;
The main character of the musical show , which I 'd like : to say was n't the " BEST " , was awfull .
I holp , you 've enjoed my experience , and I hope to hear from your soon .
The sommers winters and get warmer .
Maybe in 500 years , some people will live on the Mars and then , they , have to wear other kind of clothes .
Us will make him pay .
Do I 've to bring some , cash on me ?
There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective and he solves finally the mistery . But I , will not tell you , more .
Second , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
It was dangerous but I .
At First , when Santos Dummont invented the airplane , he probably did n't thought how the people could transform his creation .
I heard them behind talking the stage .
It is also a , suitable present for your cousin , I think .
It caused I missed the train and I went back to the hotel nearly the in mid-night .
It offer a wide choice of courses from cooking , computer , make , up , languages , geographie to culture and civilization .
I FEEL YOU LIE ME AND YOUR companies .
I mentioned it ; but they , told me that promotion had ended a long time ago .
The story describes his feelings , thoughts , fears and emotions during a struggle , with a giant deep-sea fish .
I look forward to receiving your cheque as soon , as possible .
I 'm glad to receive letter your .
I 'll look forward to , hearing answers , from you .
I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the shows at your theatre .?
I do n't like to tidy up you , know !!
Another solution could be working as a barman , the problem is that you go to bed very late , but it 's very exciting because you meet a lot of people , and enjoy your night .
I would like to suggest a in change the programme by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Firstly , we were asked to clear the stadium , especially seats the and surroundings .
In addition to this , doing internet is quite useful and helpful to .
We want to know what we willed have to wear next year but we want to know it now .
Every woman the in world likes the word shopping .
There we can see everything , about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
I when remember I was in secondary school . At that time , friends my and I was so daring and full of energy .
However , secondly , famous people are not " ailen " so that they might do something , for example , things in public space or argument with partner or family even put on swimming costume like us .
So we will have free on time the afternoon of the 14th March and we can spend this time enjoy the show .
How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours , , , shapes patterns , and uses ?
Second , I would rather stay in a log cabin , I because tend to get very nervous in small closed places , so a tent would be unapropriate for me .
In the early day , on raining a day you could n't play because most of game were outside the house but now with the technology you can make many things in your house .
If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers , tell me , I 'm in !!!
Thank you very much for your letter regarding my , prize that I won in your competition .
I is not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like .
I 'm pleasedly to be able to you help for the international student conference .
I , lack of them .
