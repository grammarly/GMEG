It was dangerous , I but knew I had to do it .
I 'm looking fordward to .
First of all you said that the starring , would be Danny Brook but there was not .
I think it 's great a opportunity because , we will have a chance to se the latest fashion , leisure and sport wear , and , as well the way to do the perfect make up and hairstyl .
But to solve this problem , we may , think first about its origin ...
The Computer was invented 30 year or mor ago and estart lake a procesing information with a big cad was perfored and maked a smol hold and aeche hold , mean something lake a Codig .
First point we will use more often new technologies telecommunication like or internet .
If people want to enjoy shopping , we must consider before buy something - do I really , want it ?
As a teenager I must addmit that there is nothing more enjoyable , from shopping .
I think if you have lots of , money and do n't know what to do with it , do not go shopping give the money to charity , is that better than shopping .
You chose can the more price suitable for you .
As Modern technology is changing the , world rapidly I think we are all involved in the revolution it 's causing .
And also the ticket discounts not available .
I hope you will find my letter of interest and I look forward , to seeing you .
That been not your advertisement had shown .
Food and beverages , will be available .
I hope , that my advice will help you .
Thank you for your attentions .
After working minute 30 , a singer appeared .
Firstly , ; ; ; ; ; despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring , another actor was starring in the actual show and his performance was literally horrible , and disappointing .
Another point is that with the help of technology the we can communicate with the whole world .
We 're always want , to know about others ' life especially the one famous even the one that we hate .
Now I , have two questions about camping .
The best thing was I spoke in English because I forgetting it and I met my favourite singer .
Well , I would be only available in July , because at that time I would , be in winter holidays .
I am looking forward , to the meeting with you and mutual work during conference .
Someone can gets to , the city centre with the No.456 bus and then on foot to the castle .
One night , heard i a strange sound .
It all comes my from parents parents parents .
But this problem .
Thank your for everything .
Morning next as Pat was going to met school Bad Jon . and told him " Hey , you you .
The fans and the press are those have who made them rich and famous .
We thought that we could change the programme this way : we could go to Science the Museum Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
You certainly saw that plays and films had a lot success of .
So she , fill her position .
When human goes to the shop and buy what they went , however I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes all sort of things .
In the past , everything was very different . ; ; ; ; ;
I has just two questions .
The aim of this report is to give some information about The new Acapulco resart which buildings was build 10 years ago and it is one of the first buildings that was build with the latest tecnonology and made by a important Mexican arquitector .
I am looking forward , to hear from you as soon as possible .
Also you asked me about two activities . ;
I also wanted to know if I have to take some money to buy souvenirs and food that or will be paid for me , too ?
Endly I , have questions about clothes and money .
I 'm very happy to know that I won the first prize .
Thank your very much .
Secondly , if you happen to forget something , you will to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers , and that can take up even more time .
Some time , before I did not .
How has modern technology our daily life ?
That are so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice .
Indeed , instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ; we were having mean actors .
Of course , it everyone less attention or interest , the situations should be better .
Its were absolutely fantastic prize .
I am representative of our class your in college to write to you .
The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines , so , today 's children must be introduced to since computers an early age , so that they could have a chance to compete with the furious emearrence in the future .
When I saw your advertisement on yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have an perfect evening as you have written on your advertisement .
In addition , it would be if nice you could send me an address which I am going to stay , so that I can in touch with my friends and family .

I was just , walking down by dressing room manager said that if I could help them .
The performances were great , but some halls was too small to accomodate so many people there were that day .
At first , expected i to find Danny Brook as the main actor , but she must have been changed since the actor was different .
It is real enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming .
Is it very expensive , area ?
I am pleasantly to have the opportunity to practice sports as well .
In my opinion in the future people will wear clothes made of an fabrics natural ; silk , cotton , leather , wool .
I would like to in travel June as I have already arranged for a part time job later this summer .
Firstly Firstly , the actors were n't those announced .
I which could bring them to be match the weather .
What , I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebreties ' .
My know that I have the chance to do two activity during this time .

Also , I prefer in a tent than in a long cabin because it is easier to clean .
We think and speak about it our in families .

There many are historical buildings remain .
Can you guess whe they , chossed for the work , " me " , yes me , I could n't belived it .
Even though I just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was , I consider myself being very successful .
All of a , sudden , a weird creature popped into he dream .

Everybody are free to dress , for the party but be considering to be appropriate .
I .
Amazingly , doctors say people to look after their bodies during Christmas time : shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains .
To be honest , next great invention of people , ; computer , ca n't work , if you have n't got the phone .
At work we have the important most thing in the world of technology , the computer . Without that we ca n't .
According to the advertisement I have seen , it is supposed to show the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , ; ; ; ; ; make up and hairstyles .

The first week was find , but , on the second week I got very seek .
Its was very sorry news to the Richard Brown .
During my holidays in London I went to see your musical show. ?
I do , welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the informations that you have asked me .
Secondly , I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kind of musics , but in this case the main problem was that some concerts hall were too small , and because of it I could n't see one of the concerts in programme .
I got their address so we can visit them , one day .
Technology is in every part of life our .
Even if my parents do n't look after me for all the matters like going out on nights or studying you do n't have to think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I ca n't play the guitar or listen to : music at a loud volume or invite my friends for a Saturday night party .
I was few of the lukiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop , concert , which took place in my town .
We would be terribly grateful , if you , accept our offer .
However , the rest of the students and I have heard , about the London Fashion and Leisure show that .
NOBODY ANYTHING us ABOUT THE CHANGES , AND WE WANT THAT YOU GIVE US BACK THE MONEY .
Please ..
Apart from this , computer 's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to , while five years ago when I did not have a computer , I had to write letters which was a slower way to contact with people .
I just imagined what it was like to a singer .
This is very interesting question for us and , maybe very important too .
It was a kind of map that showed the for place a lot of money which robbers hid .
If you really want to discover what greek history means means , we strongly recommend you to visit the hystorical museum !!!
Everyone was so jealous in the school . ,
But you ca n't imagine who was the singer , it was Sting , can you imagine ??
Secondly , technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do much more things ' than before .
All of us musts notice this fact .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month holidays each year and on the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays on , these months .
And also it is very interesting to with writers .
Both of them are as convinience as getting , there .
I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won and I is writing to you in order to give you all the details you need .
Finally , I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after show , but it was closed because it was .
I was arrived at Ireland on 2th July .
My saw the musical show in your advertisment in , my holiday .
However it also can make our very life lazy .
I am writting in order to complain about the musical " show ; Over the rainbow " .
In the end he wins but before he , is able to get back he has to " sacrifice " his fish to attacking sharks .
It were like a dream .
I really think it so sounds interesting .
I would like to know only in July because have set my holidays this month since last January January .
It is going to be very lovely and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises for students students .
Unfortunately , ; ; ; ; ; it was used to kill a lot of people .
They were .
This year , I started a private school in Dijon Dijon .
It is a famous exhibition , where are showed latest fashions , leisure and sport wear , make up and hairstyles .
I feel free as eagle a .
I 've got other questions : wich type of clothes do I have to bring bring ?
If it does not seem enough , after the show by boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theatre 's restaurant but the umpleasent surprise was that it was because all the waiters were on holiday .
At the end of the conference , there willed be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes ; jean 's is not allowed .
In the end I , was happy that I had done this job .
At home young people should help parents their do some houseworks ' .
Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to altrui respect in his privacy .
You will understand how upseting all this was , and I decided to visit your restaurant , that thinking could save my visit to the theatre , but it was closed and I had to go back to my hotel felling mad an hungry .
What my really want to say is about my recent experience experience .
The party will finish quite late so we 've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the , hotel safely .
So , man have invented machines to help him on his tasks , but nowadays , we our becoming slaves of them .
The next weekend I have an appointment with one them , but I not tell your the name because you 'll fell jalous !
At first , I would like to go travel on July , because before them I do n't have time to , travel .
Neighbours ' have .
Some , people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression .
Talking of my work , I had to mostly make the concert stage with some fellows .!
People had completely different life-styles .!
Other thing I , have to complement is about the time of the theatre .
Other sport I love is basket ball .
Among all these the theatre restaurant was closed , because , the shef and the waiters on where holiday .
I think you never realize this , until you 're not a , part of the crowd .
We could be listened for , free !
Its would .
They will hate this new thing because their will miss a party .
I am writing , from Paris where I live .
I look forward to earing , from you soon and if you could send me a brochure of this holiday I would be grateful .
I , still believe it has only a been dream !
I have never imagined I had to face this situation . ,
There are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television radio , , fax machines , and microwaves .
Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss about in the , past now and also in the future .
It was the very last day of my trip and at that time , I was in Kyoto. ?
I can really recommend your this book , it is fabulous .
Clothes that used to be made of coton , but nowadays we can be seeing shirts , pants socks .... made almost of everything .
At the end of conference there is a party a perfect opportunity for your students meet new friends all from part of word and they could speak about their experience .
Firstly , I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing as your advertisement already said , but there a was different actor instead of him at that evening .
I am for waiting your reply . ,
I 'm , writing in order to complain about your current musical show which I saw last week .
You can , take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference , it only takes ten minutes approximately .
As know you , I finished school two years , , ago .
I would like to travel in July , because it is the only month that I will be able to taken off days .
I would like to ask you , what type of clothes should I bring ?
I mean , all that flashing lights , changing the colours of them , I believe they helped much .
In the winter you 'll freeze freeze .
It could be advantage an !
They , will bounced on roads with there balloon clothes .
The second reason is the weather weather .
Yes it .
How is your sister , a Marine ?
On the other hand would i like to request all details of accommodation and if you could specifie what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to take .
I also recommend a window , shopping .
Believe me , you would never !
The conference wills be hold in The Royal Hall , and the best way to get there from the hotels is by bus .
We will pay Curly 's doctor these with money that we will earn " Pat said .
Another thing was that the show I went to was starting at 19 30 : but it started at 20 : 15 !
I is allowed to take holiday only in July .
Please , bring me with you you , in your reality ! "
If I use e-mail much more easier and cheaper . I and can send e-mail anytime .
I hope the all best for you !
I prefer that kind of accomodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but I ca n't have it , in tent .
Because this situation I very be busy on the first week of july , and I apreciate if you can give me the choice to start my " Camp California " from July 10th .
" He , is so bad .
In fact their would be only one possibility in July because I will end with my exams session at the end this of month and beginn , a practical trainning the 1rst of August .
Therefore , I would like to have , my money back .
Unfortunately yours advertisement about it was true n't !
If you chooses the post , you would be exhausted throughlly in the end of the concert .
Can you believe that I was helping in the last Britney Spears 's Concert Concert ?
Anyway it think that it 's for now .
At the end , to my opinion , It would be interesting to film a course of sport in order that our parents realise that we improve our body 's abilities , and not only our brain 's at abilities school .
Thank you very much for this occasion I , the rest of the year , I 'm working in a bank .
Could I suggest that you ? ; ; ; ; ;
Anything , as a souveniere would be quite enough for me .
I have to add that the weekend ticket was a ideal idea to all the events .
Consequently I hope that is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July , when the company I work with its suspends activities .
But we have to accept that everyone has their private , life for example when we get married or when policeman stop us on the highway , we do n't want any stranger notice that what is happening to us .
I look forward hearing to from you soon .
I really do n't know she why behave herself so badly during hers interview .
I would to prefer live in the tent cabin , I think it is more comfortable .
It closed at 11 , pm .
Choosing from lot a of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me .
This mostly is because I have a job I and have made further arrangements for the other summer months .
But now I am thinking that it was a waste of , time .
I want you to how extraordinary moments I passed with my friends in the festival .
At the end I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect and I wold be glad if you could pay my money some back .
I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE , GOOD .
Your freezer tells you when you have to buy , some milk , eggs or chees .
I realy got to know them , after the concert .
From the list of , activities all I have choosen photography and golf .
Furthermore , sometimes you can not and you eventually buy a low quality product .
There are links between greenhouse the , technology and me .
In the advertisment for the show you said that one of the starring was going to be Danny Brook , and to my surprise it was a different actor , and it disapoint realy me .
Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information need faster than you can imagine .
During the afternoon , Tim and me spent the hours the before concer laying on the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held .
We saw a advertisement about Fashion And Leisure Show .
However , I have a some proposals about its improving next year .
Shopping is not always enjoyable enjoyable .
Us bought the tickets and then we sit down to rest .
Can you think you contact with anyone , who is from any country whenever you want ?
Pat was gone to Anna 's and she seemed really unhappy .
Therefore , people ' used to shopping weekly or monthly .
So , I am going , to choose Golf and Tennis .
Fortunately Fortunately , it is not far from college our .
Believe it , or not I put , make up on one famous singer 's face .
They are filled , by people ' who went buy everything .
There , is a storm and they .
On the other hand and as , a conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living sourrended by lots of gadgets with differents functions .
He kept , forgetting lines his .
Fist of all , it would be a good thing to say that July be would the best time to travel because it is hotest mounth in the year , and the weather shall be really nice .
It was our , family secret 's .
I learnt from you letter that I .
Had we been trapped in the snowy , almost vertical slopes of the " Tête Blanche " for more than ten hours , by then .
It seems , ages since I wrote to you .
During my time in California , I would love to have the , of chance some leisure activities such as swimming . It is my favourite sport .!
This prize , I can two activities , ca n't you .
Firstly , there was a different actor instead of the famous actor actor , Danny Brook .
In my opinion staying in log cabins is , funnier and much cleaner .
I am not satisfied with your show as was compeletly from different advertisement .
It dangerous was , but I knew I had to do it .
On my third day I helped them to install sound the system .
Although the show , I am rather disappointed with it it .
First of all , the principal character , but a substitute and , the theatre had not notified the audience about this changing before .
I would n't .?
Secondly , I suppose the show will at 19 : 30 , but it started t 20 : 15 .
We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention , time is not a problem really .
That is why I woulds like to do that .
Well , it the , best time of my life !
However , the press should n't create rumours ' and hunt those people like animals animals .
If you have any time left you shopping .
And it on theirs attitude to life and on their character .
Students start their day at the Gym , where they learn the importance of being fit , that is way I to suggest film this activity .
I went to this festival with four friends and of all enjoyed us our time very much .
I also , would like to get some information about weather .
As I saw from your advertisement in the newspaper , it said ' Starring : Danny and brook Tina Truelove ' .
Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills , making this a trip to remember .!
And the restorant of the theatre , so I could not go as you said in the advertisment .
In the future we wo n't by clothes by size or even color , our clothes will adapt to our body the , weather , our fit so our , necessities .
I mean would £700 be enough for me , for one week ?
Thank you very much for , your letter of 1/6/00 I was really amazed with the new that I 'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
You , know , he is my favourite singer .
I was very disappointed ! ; ; ; ; ;
What you expect when you go shopping , generally with a friend or two , is wandering , around and looking at everything .
Waiting for , your answer , receive our greetings .
Do you know what Kim , I 've never thought before , that enjoying yourself like , this could be weirdly .
I am really surprised that I have won won .
What , do you think about that ?
But about differences between rich 's and poor 's homes will the be same in the futur .
Luckely I could keeps my secret for a couple of days but then , it became urgent and I needed someone to talk to .
I have n't got mine mobile phone with me And I was half way between my school and home .
I thank you very much for hearing , my request . I apologise any for inconvenience it could make . I am certain you would think about over that particular visit to to to " the London fashion and leisure show " . On of behalf all the students .
The party its will be , nice .
Firstly , I would like to mention is that in our daily life we always use some technologically machines . For instance , TV-set , stereo , microwave oven and , others .
If , it , sould be possible we can make an interview to the last winner .
It will be great to two weeks at Camp California .
Nonetheless , people still , find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake .
I am looking forward to .
The most important things is the fugure , such as legs long or pear-sharped .
We were allowed to go out if we did n't want to .
I told you that I have helped at a , pop concert last month .
With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisment , would i like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take in consideration .
All I ought to do .
First , I have to say that I can travel only in July this year .
The reason of my option for singing is couse I feel embarrest about my voice ; so maybe I could .
When I saw the advertisement of the show it was that the show will started at a half past seven but started at a quarter past eight .
Afterwards they .
Thirdly , the disappointment made me a bit hungry but the restaurant was closed without the any sign saying why .
We think that , if you do n't have any problem , we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can to go the London Fashion and Leisure show .
As you know , I am a member of a BSB fan club , and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert their gave in the city where I live .
I it think can make your festival more popular .
Back in the 30 's the different governments , armies .
That 's why I 'd like to ask if you could give me some money , back .
As well as all the treasures , statue and historically paintings ... There also are restaurent 's and modern gallaries .
In spite of our decadence , some cheap souls still have the courage to say that , by shopping , they 're filling empty their spaces .
The bus will be service at 9.30 PM and 11.30 PM then at the end , of the party will be the last one .
Was i disappointed when I found the actor was n't Danny Brook !
Consequently , I to change the programme as follows ; on Tuesday afternoon , instead of shopping , we could go to this show and we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon , during our free time .
But But , while reading realistic stories , I just fall deep into the story , into the writer 's own world .
Hopefull I . So play as a team .
I always dreamed about going to the , California and now my dreams are coming truth .
Do you ?
The computer is very , useful and It has affect our own lifes , in differents meanings .
It show can how much students are enjoying , their life in our school .
We were there , alone , my friend with his broken leg and myself myself .
They are able to give and .
In this book , Heathcliff as a child had n't a bad character but the situations lived with the family Earnshaw , where the up , made him rude , agresive and noisy .
The shopping centre is just right opposite of the hotel , however , some people may want to just at wait the hotel , having a cup of coffee .
I you will consider my , suggestion .
Do you not have waste money at all .
I sign must , off as I want to catch the post .
That means for exampel while you are in the you office are able to controll your home with the computer .
In my opinion , maths , politics , chinese English , and painting lessons are most the interesting ones .
So I , will very happy to improve my art in the camp .
I have good singing skills too too .
I SUGGEST , THAT us SHOULD GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW .
First , of all , that famous people deserve to have private life .
Us will be more comprehensible with others .
I 'm writing this letter to you , because during stay my in London , I went to the theatre to see a musical show , and I had a very disappointing evening .
How is , about an accommodation .
As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone singing a song , I saw a number of famous musicians nearby .
From the begining of the century to now , modern technology has changed and has made , our daily life easier .
They are always expected to be beautiful , intelligent intelligent , good-looking .
I were very excited when I could see a star !
Therefore I read Agatha Christie 's , , Best Detective Stories Agatha of , Christie " .
Believe me , shopping can also , be painful .
So stay in a log cabins will probably evite a me lot of , problems .
In your previous letter you asked information about interesting building to visit in my country country .
The school works together known with companies of the branch as Mariot hotel , Air France Princess cruise among others in order to provide students with high qualified training .
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders , I , I had to see it .
They ca communicate n't with ordinary children and attend ordinary schools .
I , would like to travel on july because I am a studant therefore I only have holidays in this part of the year .
The for ticket the show is , included .
I 'm writing to you because I want you to give , the money back for your " London 's newest and best musical show : Over the rainbow " , presented in the Circle Theatre .
When received I your letter with photographs of that flat , it really looked nice .
An other thing , in such a bad show .
Upgraded it , the building every year .
I have also been that they were going to make a music video from that concert , so I tried as well as I could .
In addition to , that realistic stories are more attractive , I personally do n't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they can not be true .
I am exciting and looking forward to , doing camp there .
My am very delighted to visit the two weeks Camp California in the U.S.A. .
But I think I will , choose Basketball and Photography , because basketball is only the sport I can play well .
Moreover , student are , allowed to admit for free .
As far as I am concerned , I would prefer an accomodation in a log cabin , but in case there are no cabins left I can , stay in a tend as well .
I two made albums about birds and flowers life life .
I to wait for , 45 minutes without nothing doing .
I think that it will be nice about the end-of-conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the , student the time to enjoy theirselves and to dance .
Thank you , to ask me my taste and to be preoccupated about it .
I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved , bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering , into their lives .
I 'd like to change a rule at home home .
I want to say thank your that I was the lucky person won who that competition .
After the show decide i to had dinner in your , theatre restaurant , but I could n't because it closed .
The London fashion and Leisure Show will on start Tuesday .
About the Accomodation I would prefer to sleep on the tents because , I never been in one , and it is a lot more fun than log cabins .
" Reading the gossips " : is n't it what anyone , of us love doing ??
This story was happened a long time ago .
I hope my recommendations will help in you the choice of a building to visit .
But when I went there , was it closed .
Month last helped i the service crew at a pop concert .
I , have taken a Photography course and I enjoy taking photos to animals .
Someone says is maths , pratical , usefull but the majority says it is boring , unless you 're chose a job which charges all your math 's knowledge as accounting , otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer .
AT 20 : 00 , we stopped in a coffee house , to eat . The shouted : " 20 : 30 you all have to be back because the bus , will leave . "
I am , looking forward to staying in contact with you .
I AM WRITIN TO YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE , KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU .
I would like to inform , you that I am able to go there only in July .
However , journalists shoulds not only think commercial about value , but morality and priciples are also being concerned .
As a result , journalists , and always write real news .
I , went to the theatre last weekend to see " Over rainbow the ' .
I have , something really exciting to .
I will started an course italian in August , so it will be impossible for me to leave .
The show has begun later much , more later than your advertisement writes , at about 20 : 15 . The show started 45 minutes later. :
By the way , I 'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should prepare how and much much I should bring with myself .
They , just said , " us do n't give money back . "
Otherwise If are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood .
It 's a great opportunity because in our fast developing world we have to look fashionable and this kinds of show happens quite rare .
Technology is the thing makes that our life easy .
I would like to you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on the 5th April is suitable for you .
But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to the exams .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me , about the two weeks at Camp California that I won. !
Thanks a , lot for your letter .
Moreover I practised a lot of aspect of mine speciality , for me was the most important real experience .
The technology is essencial to our life , we need it each on minute , on each second .
Regarding , your questions , the following are my answers .
The , starring had been changed , the show had started only at 20 : 15 , and , there were no discounts available .
So , you will enjoy traditional foods , music , dances and games from all over the world .
According to the advertisement , Danny Brook would be starring but was it a different actor .
A survey has been done , and the issue is , wich , subjects ( lessons ) and activities the students thinks are the most enjoyables .
I well tried to do so but the lady at the desk told me that their were quotas available at that price but were already sold out !
The military technology has affected our lives more than what we , think because most of the equipments we use were originally created by those people people .
I was excited I that had a closer look so at many famous pop stars .
When the important day , it says to me .
Was paul wandering wether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words " I am glad to meet you , Paul . "
From one side , this , people chose to become public people .
I would like to travel on July , because it is the summer and the weather is sunny , moreover I am totally free while this month .
Besides , we would like go to the London Fashion And Leisure Show , which was advertised in the newspaper " Metro " yesterday .
I just wonder how many time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying cloths .
It would be also very interesting to film the situation while the brake . The smokers in the school yard , the buffett and the other pupils , who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework homework .
Unfortunatelly , I will be able to only go in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for this dates .
It will , be very awful .
I love swimming and also 've i got a scubar divings licence .
Technology nowadays something is everybody has on your own mind .
Do you have any rules , at school that make you upset ?
My , family very love , him and support us .
And it , has free-entrance for the students .
Maybe children will not have , to go to school , they just will stay in their rooms and study from computer , some kind of on-line education .
Secondly , it . Forty five minutes later ! ; ; ; ; ;
I look forward to from you in the very near future .
We have been for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people .
Finally , I preciate your organisation and look forward to from the next International Arts Festival .
All the students in my class is excited about one , , more thing .
It was n't usual fish , it was Gold Fish and it asked him as human ; ' Please , let me go and I can do for anything you you want ' .
You . And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a very perfect book !
However However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March .
When I stay home I can watch or listen to the , radio e.t.c . so the , modern technology help me to spend my free time .
At is explain it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before . ; ; ; ; ;
After the play play , which turned out to , be just as bad as I thought , I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant , but it was closed , and for no reason !
Even if I worked hard on it , I was very surprised of winning just the firstly prize .
Almost everything . For example , education , researching of Universe the and others others .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to takes place on 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
Moreover , the play did not start , at the time it was supposed to .
The reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast itselves , want i one more exciting and that asks for more agility and another more calm and relaxing , that asks only for my ability to paint .
Would we be grateful , if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hearing from you soon .
It is sometimes a real fight who will take , the first picture of a film star or a politician .
About two weeks ago , I went to London for , a week holiday .
Also they , are showing their first play on the 2nd of July .
New technologies and facilities wo shall n't improve the , relationship between people .
Realistic stories thus , our develop imagination and creativity , which are essential in our lives .
It 's one of the most things important for me , to have a chance to forget about all my present , luxurious life and try doing something different .
That children of famous people suffer an lot from this attention .
To begin with , in your letter you asked me when I would like to , travell .
I am certain you would think about over that particular visit to to to " the London fashion and leisure show " . On of behalf all the students .
I want , playing tennis and swimming. ,
MY NAME , JAMES CAMIREZ AND I'AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLEINTS FOR THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
I am writing , this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday .
As I did n't to be successful , I am happy very about this result .
" What will clothes like 100 years from now ? "
Each of us had a task different .
I think that it will has a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that , for example , we can turn on the lights of , the bedroom just pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa .
What you think about this plan ?
On last the day I , go to your house and then we think about our 's conference plane .
Perhaps I , I took .
I prefers to live in tents because I feel very natural .
On the other hand , if you think that you 'll be on the red I , 'd better stay at home .
At people the backstage including me were helping to clean up all the stuff and ready for the end of the concert .
Mathematics teachers do great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons lessons .
Finally I 'm writing to let you know about the most excitingly experience in my life .
It was not our fault that we went in after pm 11 .
I am really happy to receive letter about Camp California , from you .
Us could n't imagine our life without them .?
I realised that it was different actor playing instead of the Danny brook .
There were supposed to be discounts for tickets the , what appeared , to be wrong to .
From the beggining it was , all a disappointment .
Of most them are flats which have at lest 20 Floors .
I 'm not quite a young man and during the past years of my life I gothave become , accostomed to some more comfort .
After , a while , she pulled herself together and paused for a minute .
But in the other hand , I have never done surfing , I am a completely Beginer but I am dieing to , do it .
Fashion of , Future the .
At the ticket office I also asked for a discount but they told me this , was n't possible , instead your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available !
I would also like to know in advance the amount money of I need to bring for expenses that will not be included .
I would like to ask , if you ?
After show the we went , to the theatre restaurant but it closed .
It made it possible to discover , to talk with new people on the Internet but also to join and to be joined by my or friends parent .
I have n't a clue about , its .
I was thinking ' what , shoulds I do ? '
I when must buy something , I usually ca n't find it and then the shopping become a nightmare .
Finally , I would like to enquire about how much money I should , take with me and also what kind of clothes would be most suitable to wear .
So I am very grateful to man , who invented it , unfornutely , I , have forgotten his name .
Finally , I would like , the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very at good keeping secrets .
The salewomen are too and busy have n't a moment for give you a counsil service .
It wills begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last , until midnight .
I do n't know why and I 'd like : you to tell me , the reason .
We .
They wanted to famous be and the .
You wanted to hear about experience my at the pop , concert which I enjoyed helping last month ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR LIFE daily ?
I 'm .
Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing , because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool so that I am good at swimming swimming .
In my opinion shopping just is to cover our basic needs .
Every day day , like everybody , I watch the TV , see the International news , hear the radio , play games on my computer or get across with American or Asia people without going out to my house .
I am one your of husband 's students .
How , has modern technology changed your , daily life ?
First , I helped selling the tickets .
What is impressive on building this is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
Finally , could , you tell me if I have to bring some clothes , towels ' and extra money ?
It 's , good chance for you to improve your English .
The clothes ' is part of each culture and one of these things which expresses our taste and personality .
It would difficult be and take more time to make an appointment .
Regarding to the end-of-conference party I , would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man , though , it is no formal do .
We have organised to do the party between three to six o'clock in afternoon in College Canteen , about food we organised , a buffet , but could you also help us with the music which he prefer , if prefer something especialy .
I helped at an pop concert of a newcomer group and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
It so was necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
I would also take an outdoor , lesson " training " .
You had to the start show at 19.30 p.m. but started you too late at 20.15 p.m withour any ecxpenetion to people .
On my most first day I did n't work .
Styles mix , colours and shapes back come from the past , only the fabrics are different .
A friend of , me gave up one , week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place .
Unfortunately , the musical show annoying was .
Last before least , I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes my should bring to America .
The queue is not only problem the if you go by car there is parking problem , if you go by bus there is again queue and you have to carry many carry bag carrier bags during the your journey and you wo n't be alway luky to find a seat to seat .
But I 'm really happy , that I had even small role in making people enjoying they .
I would you informed we before .
The other one is the , television .
As above mentioned , please take care to give me more information , and if your 'd like to know more , please telephone me for further discussion .
We often go to out sing Karaoke in bar .
I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have .
Firstly , what kind clothes of I have to take to the camp , clothes for hot or cold weather ?.
I am not , really satisfied about it .
First , that clothes should I bring ?
I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you are in , New York on holiday .
Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not and it overall is not always enjoyable .
I did not get discount . :
I know you have a , good taste in presents !!
It was said it that would start at 19.30 but it was not .
The group has been into booked Palace Hotel which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held .
I .
First of all , your must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there .
I am forward looking to travelling .
The purpose that I am writing due to the fact that my class has seen a advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Besides , the theatre restaurant had closed down before I out went of the show .
Tecnology , are we for those advances ?
However , we have seen an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper the for London Fashion and Leisure Show .
A crowded hall is good not to enjoy musics .
I have sung in the church 's choir for three years , and I have had singing classes at school since first , grade .
50 years ago , Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food food .
So , I have some opinions to this , I which would to like tell .
Anyway , we still want to go to the Science Museum and shopping as , well but we think we can go shopping on the last day afternoon of our trip .
Famous people ' , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following they all the time .
The festival , was very well organiced with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows .
Thank you very much for your letter I , was glad to get it and know a lot of news about you .
I would appreciated it if you supply some towers towers , if possible .
I would prefer surfing or climbings but I have to think in my helth .
I was very surprised , when I saw singers that are n't so sophisticated and self-confident as they are in the newspapers .
What is it what we use every , day many hours ? Sometime 's early in , the morning until late in the evening .
I think if we wear this clothes we will travel to every where easier than we use cars , ships , planes ' and space ships .
In the future , it will be able to help people even more since it been increasing its capacity day after day .
To sum up , I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent reasonably-priced ticket like this year 's .!
The other point bad was the time when the show started , it was already 20 : 15 when the first star entred on the scene , but your advertisement sayed 19.30 !
The people use the telephone also for , their personal life . For example when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who , lives far away .
Technical and Warm Home People 's , way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology .
I received your letter this morning and was i very suprised it .
You can not only listen to her best detective stories stories , but also learn English automatically .
Only the problem is that on 4th April I have my graduation .
Modern technology has changed my daily life from physical activity to mental activity ( ?? ) :
But the problem is when my want to buy only one thing , for example bread . On Friedy evening and at on the weekdays each supermarkets are , crowded .
The activities are quite hard to choose really , because you have a lot of chose is which I like .
Finaly I would to like ask you for a some further informations about the clothes and the money we will need .
Another problem is , my realised that the discounts were available . However , there was any n't discount .
Her is very , intelligent .
What , we all , did was making many cups of coffees and help to find their missing socks or any other clothings .
We can .
My look forward to .
Instead of going , shopping we could go to the show .
Besides all , those improvements and confort I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us .
In every country there , are the famous people who are in the middle of the public attention .
In addition of this , it .
In conclusion I think that people who are to much interested in other people life have not an interesting lifes and are unhappy !
First of all could you let us know if the date of June is 16th all right with his timetable program .
What do you think if we will , go to the visit Arts Museum ?
In 1874 Lorca was the , most beautiful white girl in her city ( a , small town near Savannah ) .
I learned painting when I school student .
In conclusion conclusion , I wanted to say thanks , for such an special weekend .
Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person . ;
Your work was brilliant , because you brought stars and artists from the around world with only that reasonable-priced ticket we paid for all the weekend .
When I was a child I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs I that liked , but it was nearly impossible to have them .
So when I read other sharks eating the shark the old man had catches , I got very angry and annoyed .
On the other hand , I would like to notice that the festival would be able to appeal to more people if a little improvements , were made .
This are an experience , ? I 'll never forget .
Besides of all , at the end of the Musical , I went to the your Theatre Restaurant , in order of taking a dinner , because I have leaft home eating without and so my was hungry at that time .
It , closed at 10 pm but the show finished at 10.30 pm .
First of all I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook , but sadly he was n't there , he was filled in by a different actor , who instead rather disappointing .
We lived here in rush , there but was a lot of fun , too .
If I want to buy a nice pair of shoe , I 'll have to , go into a city centre and browse around from shops to shops until I find the shoes I like .
However , I , never tried to go surfing .
How modern technology changed my daily life ?
The door it is broken , we can replace , it rapidly and it is not expensive when it is plastic .
Well Well , I suppose that almost everything in future house will be automatic and will obey to what people say .
I always had my own key and unlock door the by myself .
As for me , ! the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer .
I am writting to tell you about my experience in the last month pop concert , where I was helping my friend Nick who was the bouncer the of place .
Sudden a murderer happens !
I was really amazedly to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions !
In your advertisement announced you the actors were , Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Moreover , once I was going , to pay for the tickets , I found another thing : there were no discounts avaible .
When I neaded some I informationes had to go to liblary to find it in books or newspapers .
I am forward looking to your reply letter .
Without doubt , discovering of the computer is the most important technologically event event .
Or never living the office you able are to heat the wather for a hot bath .
I , was so disappointed .
I am writing to you in order give you a some advice about the annual International Arts Festival .
BUT IT WASN'T THE WORSE , BECAUSE I CAN be understanding TROUBLES the TO PLAY ON THE THEATRE .
Your advertisement says ' discounts available ' but it was , not available .
I am able to meet my friends quickly in Internet just clicking mouse the .
Maybe it is right say that in a flat instead , of a building .
Last May , I had a week holiday in a London , and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW , the MUSICAL SHOW .
I look , forward to .
They are famous , ; ; ; ; ; but I think they needs to be alone sometimes .
It looked at me , and said .
The director of College the has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice .
They also took me to a after hour party and they asked I if would like do this again .
Due to the fact my that children have summer holiday from July . I prefer to stay in log cabins , therefore I 'm going to traveling with 2 children my and dog .
I would rather type some coursework up than , hand-write it .
Firstly , I found that there were no discounts , as it was announced in the advertisement .
It 's like a joke , but a bit , scarely .
I let this pass and I bought it anyway , thinking that was posible that was it only an mistake in your advertisement .
If it is possible I .
Recently I visited arts an festival , organized with your help .
or can we ?
Then I 'd like to join activities the , swimming and Singing .
Finally , I helped them them , in return I .
No doubt she would never never look at me again .
We have to think about this , way .
Where 's the , fun in that ?
I guess science is about solving our daily problems technological with advances .
During break time I did give a lots of direction to people who ca n't find toilet , and information such like where , they could have a cup of coffee .
The first thing I do when I arrive in my office are switch on my computer .
If not , you cans go the Saturdays but badly , there are too costumers . You ca might n't walk , try clothes , it 's very hot .
Was i really great .
I , hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference .
The finished show late .
I looks forward to seeing you .
Will what clothes be like 100 years from now ?
Probably , because their parents have n't enough time to go out the city and shows them nature .
The Barbican Centre built in 1975. ? Apart from Banks and important offices offices .
I am now writting this letter to give you further information , about myself with pleasure .?
These things me provide all convenience .
I , have given much information of , the international student conference .
So in fact people 's home become more confienence and comfortabler .
Finally , could you tell me how far is the , nearest town or village ?
Is its hot enough ? ; ; ; ; ;
On top of this we intend to go to the theatre restaurant which was .
Lastly , it could nice be to students who are interested in arts , if you help special events , for instance , song contest , writing competition or dance lessons .
Even I had planned something else to do I agreed because she 're my very good friend .
From any point of view , the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have , today .
First , I tell you the name of the hotel it , 's the Palace Hotel .
It been so long since I wrote to you for last time ...
Anyway , I 'll tell you about my wonderful , experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert .
Nowadays it 's getting obvious that designers sold only details , but significantly changes do n't turn up .
This event was not what call I : " a perfect evening " out , as your advertisement promised .
The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting every one wit BB guns . ;
The , biggest is disadvantage pollution .
In addition to this , the show , did not start on time , 19 30 : , so I had to wait for 45 minutes .
The designer will have a lot of , idea for how to make very nice and useful clothes .
To begin with , the actor you publised was going to perform , did , n't .
I think it , was the water .
I really am looking forward take part at Camp California .
The maching used for read this cad was too big you use to need a room UNKNOWN our Computer .
The , end-of-conference party is designed to give rough ideas about many , different cultures .
There we will have the chance to be maked up or to try new hairstyles , too too .
Because , the London Fashion programme takes place on Tuesday , I would suggest to change your plan .
I immediately , say " yes yes " and also my friend .
I understood you want to know when am I available and where I 'd like to stay .
At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed so I run to mine brother in order to explain him what I had seen .
She will to Liverpool next week and I 'll put her up .
I am writing to complain about , a musical show I went one week ago .
It contains a wide range of activities for example , sightseeing , river trip , visiting science museum gallery and , shopping shopping .
I feel entitled , to compensation for this event .
Thank you for organising , the trip to a London .
Secondly Secondly , could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin , because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents .
the most important thing is that you wisely choose the , most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO hearing FROM YOU IN A VERY NEAR FUTURE FUTURE .
If have please tell me .
Pat told him that I was in love with he .
Perhaps , there will be personal computers , which will control every thing , every item of furiture , light , temperature temperature .
It was unbelievable and as tiring well .
Last but not less importantly is the class called " know-how " wich shows students how to cope with unspected problems even if they are in stress .
I am also trying to decide on the amount of moneys I should bring .
I am writing to give , an information on a very interesting building to visit .
I hope I 'll be able to on travel July . Due to the fact my that children have summer holiday from July .
Hope we join the next pop together concert as a stuff and enjoy our time !
So my see point .
I ...
Thank you very much for many interesting position in this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are shure , will be very exciting .
My , they are not like us .
In general , the rules at private schools are much harder the than ones at state schools .
All the rubbish , dust , ! dirty dishes , plates , caps will be washed and cleaned automaticly .
" You see , I am a mere product of your mind , but I would like to , go out of the Heavy Sleep .
The restaurant should had been oppened when I came , out , but it was closed because of the hour the show finished .
I , am just coming back from a week 's holiday in London , which has been all , in all really nice .
Let me know if you , are going to come so that I prepare the bedroom to put you up .
In addition we are fascinated in their marriage , ; ; ; ; ; children , holidays ' etc .
The people who there were to watch the show and they were shouting because they were waiting for too long , And I absolutely agree with them .
You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have , buying clothes , jewells , furnitures , etc . and you could a have real great time .
But the positive new way technology has changed my life is in way to communicate .
Firstly , I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment with your musical show but it , was not the case .
Waiting for you replay . ; ; ; ; ;
I would also like to know some more details about what sort clothes of I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which will be necessary for me to take .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating , evening out I had .
You should review the advertisements ' you do because you give wrong information information .
However , we saw an advertisement , and we are keen on the idea of to going the London Fashion and a Leisure Show .
Hers boyfriend , Guy Richie , was there too , and he 's a really good person .
I prefered to come at 19 : 30 because it is better at night and it would n't late , but the theatre started at 20 : 15 and we got bored waiting to start .
Communications move the world and famous people use them to improve theirs work , politicians for , their campain and film stars to make famous their last movie .
No matter that people started worred about more polution in the world .
A couple of weeks later , my sister called me as I was at work ; completely devastated and weaping scalding , tears she could , hardly pronounce a word .
For getting from the hotel to the conference , your only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St . James , college where the conference will take place .
Anyway Anyway , what you wanted to know was what been my job .
We think it will be a opportunity great because it will take place while our visit to London , the 14th of March .
And it 's not ending , I hope that for , my thirties I 'll go to Mars on holidays ...
At the end of the summer we are planning to a cousin who lives in Australia .
This is a precise letter that I you write now .
There are some things I would like to ask : the tipe ( and quantity ) ; of Clothes I will have to take , if it is necessary to take some money and any additional stuff ( like raincoates ) .
Everthing is now easy .
so it would be greatful if you can give us this opportunity to watch the show .
Another important thing , is that , despite the number and , quality of films , there were , from my point of view , not many plays .
My job I had to help Sting in everything , for example if he wanted water , I had to give to him water , it was marvellous .
.
But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt wether to , use it or not . Especially now , when ' big-mouth ' Pat spread the news to litterally everyone .
In this domain , your have to afford everyday the development of new technology .
When the play " over the Rainbow " finished I tried to eat something , but the fact were that the theatre restaurant was closed , because your personal were cleaning all the troubles that a old dog did .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work , mine current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
First of an all I recommend you to go on the 8 a.m. boat .
My in opinion technology have made human life easily , funier and more comfortable .
Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about , this because Pat was n't very good at , keeping secrets .
Probably she 'll come with a friend if you want you can , enjoy us .
Technology allows to have more time distractions to to or other things we really like to .
Home made out of plastic windows also made out of plastic therefore we can have our home for a long time .
He / she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he / she needs , even though the owner is from far the house .
I am writing to express my , dissapointment about the play " over the rainbow " which is performing at Circle Theatre .
It were n't very pleasant .
Then I can prepare my clothes suitable for weather that .
So , I wanted to know if will there more films next year .
Every person in the world looks for technology everyday improve the way they live their own life .
It felt to be a good memory to be remember and , our remind sleves to speak in a correct way .
But , sometimes I asks myself if the " ancient world " , without science , technological discoveries and industries was more authentic than the our one .
Concerning Singing activities , I 'm quite good as I have been in my school 's choir for 3 years .
I said " yes " and I sure it was the best decision of my life .
Specially , I like water painting painting .
I apprieciate this shops for lots of products , cheep prices end big , spaces .
It is expensive also and I ca n't afford to stay there too long .
Here are the which information you asked me for .
Also change my free time , they had invented great games like play station , and you can a really good time with your friend playing .
actually they came from only six countries .
And my really disappointed , from the different actor 's performance .
This way we coulds obtain seldom places at NASA university .
All of them , . As well as , this they started to talk about it everywhere .
It is good start to go on sightseeing by bus on Monday morning , we can se all famously buildings in an few hours .
Personally I do n't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops , so I buy all I what can using " on-line " services .
Finally , it .
I think that if we mix lessons with sport activities combination the will give us complete success .
I 'm sure us will find another solution .
I do n't like tinking , my house of , my life , without all this facilities . In winter when is dark very early , ? and after , I .
One story is about ten persons who , stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
However , I go far away from my family and other people and .
Hope you will it enjoy .
I helped setting up the sound equipment , !
We prepared some , special attraction like live dance music and hot or cold buffet .
I was , very surprised on the result of the competition .
He actually went to and carla told her every thing .
As , you can see , most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided .
I 'm very happy and at lazy the same time .
For example , the advertisement that said Danny Brook would be the lead actor , but he was not .
These could save life life !
Althoug I wich that my accommodation at Camp California it must be in tents . ; I get , experience in the last summer .
I would ask you to mine moneys back .
I think , it was very cleaver of me to record that moment wich I will never ever forget , and that was the think that I more of liked that experience .
Based on everything listed above , I would to recieve £10 , which I have paid , back .
Unfortunately , it could have an inconvenient for me because of pollutions from cars , factories .
Furthermore the , show started at the wrong time .
During it , everybody wills have the opportunity to met and talk to the speakers of the conference .
It change every days and I do not know if we will be able , to understand it .
Then Then , by some ' strange power ' my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it , but it was too difficult .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT. 10 MINUTES AFTER I WAS FOLLOWING HIM , I START KNOWING THE PLACE , AND I WAS FELLING MORE CONFORTABLE .
After waiting a while in this uncomfortably place the show started , I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared , but I find myself that the main one was n't Danny Brook , it was an impostor .
We what you have done and your dog will be sold " .
However , I , must , say , it was quite the opposite .
Who of you could imagine life without , the telephone ? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for an moment ? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because , of an illness , without having to look her in the , eye ?
Well , that would to be all .
Purpose the of this letter , is just to let you know my opinion of the event .
Last month I helped a at pop concert , it was marvellous .
Fortunately Fortunately , the people from my class are really great and we love all trips - especially interesting ones .
Its , is very useful .
To make the matter worse , I had expected the ticket with some discount , but when I went to the ticket box , there no any discount available .
By chosing this style of , life they should realise , how their life would look like .
I did n't get , involved that much in but the main idea of the background of the stage was my , and I am very proud of it .
Is there , only one teatcher for each sport , and how many are we in each group of activities ?
" Yes Yes , Oh Lord he did it because we won his team at football " Nick said .
I am , very well at playing basketball .
First of all , I will be able to travel , in July because I has not finished school .
Also in the advertisment you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't , And also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show to , eat some thing or to have a drink .
In conclusion conclusion , if you go shopping reasonably , have a good time .
There are many sources of light in this world a such as sunlight , moonlight , candle light .
Now then , how was this advertising , it was completely diffarent , I am real disappointed your musical , I am ask you for money back , because I was n't enjoyed your musical .
Modern technology have change my daily life in , many aspect .
I often like getting gifts , for my relatives and friends .
I go , to swimming-pool two time by week , so I am good at this sport .
When I was younger I remember when that I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching on , libraries looking for old books .
I was dangerous , I but knew I had to do it .
From my point of view , people 's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine , TV , cooker and the light , connecting , to the owner .
So they can be just ordinaly , people like us .
When you work a in office , a manufactory , a society , you have the same planning to them . So you just can go to do a shopping , during your lunch break .
Mine , name is John and I have been in the latest International Arts Festival .

I 've never been to California , therefore please let , me know about the weather there .
The shopping great when you have lots of moneys , times ; you can buy clothes , shoes , make-up ; CD , whatever .
Another disappointing thing was that you did not explained the reason why it was delayed 20 by : 15 .
When you take the class on the computer programming , you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics , because you have to , study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysys .
Please send me a list the of items I many need there including , the most appropriate clothes for the american weather .
I was disappointed terribly .
Celular phone can be inconvenient sometimes , but it can be very useful in certain situations : when your car is broken on the road , when you need to be found anywhere and at any time ( if you are a doctor , a lawyer or a journalist , for instance , ) and so forth .
To make things even worse , the play did n't start at 19 : 30 as it was supposed to but instead it started 45 minutes late , at 20 : 15 , and there , were n't even your famous discounts available .

Finally , my parents are all the time argueing about differents solutions ' to my problem , and this all thanks to Pat .
I am writing to complain about yours musical show .
Maybe you will spend all your money for a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to night-club but your are short of money .

Should I bring my camera , warm , clothes or any pocket money ?
I could be interested in your , letter .

Between male and female willed .
I had to wait all that times in the street , because the hall was not big enough .
You me about my experiences .
What do you want more more ?
Your dance shows are very beautiful , art exhibitions is original something and exciting .
I am glad very that I have won first prize in your competition and I can go to the United States .
The restaurant should open until , the show finish .
If you have more questions about the conference and , something else , do not hesitates to ask me .
Although the jazz , rock and classical music was great , concerts some and are halls too small , could you consider making them bigger next year .
For accommodation I would prefer a tent , as I and I like going camping an lot .
And what is , the weather like ?
Lastly , the restaurant which was to going be opened was in fact closed without a reason !
I 'm writing to you regarding the radio , programme next Saturday where " The old man and the Sea Sea " by Earnest Hemingway will be read .

It was a big fault to gave her a secret , ! especially an important one .
With the help of some modern technology our daily life would not so , difficult .
It always happens with people , does n't n't ?
We imagine that would be the best holidays , in our life .
they started charging down the field towards the fire and once in range everyone thew their balloon as far as they .
Moreover there were not any discounts and all of the tickets had the prizes same .
My sometimes want heard their voice on the telephone .
The season for this is the global warming , which is the salvation of the problem another and reason why this idea is possible .
I helped with the selling of the tickets , with the security security , with the designing ...

Another aspect is that people 've more time if they have a telephone .
