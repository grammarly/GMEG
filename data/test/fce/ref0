It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
First of all , you said that the star would be Danny Brooks , but it was not .
I think it 's a great opportunity because we will have a chance to see the latest fashion , leisure and sportswear , as well as the way to do perfect makeup and hairstyles .
But to solve this problem , we should think first about its origin .
The computer was invented over 30 years ago . It started out processing information from a big card that was perforated with small holes , and each hole meant something , like a code .
First of all , we will use more often new technologies like telecommunications and the internet .
If people want to enjoy shopping , we must consider before buying something - do I really want it ?
For a teenager , I must admit , there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping .
I think if you have lots of money and do n't know what to do with it , do not go shopping . Give the money to charity ; that is better than shopping .
You can choose the price most suitable for you .
As modern technology is changing the world rapidly , I think we are all involved in the revolution it 's causing .
Also , the ticket discounts were not available .
I hope you will find my letter interesting , and I look forward to seeing you .
That was not what your advertisement had shown .
Food and beverages will be available .
I hope that my advice helps you .
Thank you for your attention .
After working for 30 minutes , a singer appeared .
Firstly , despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring , another actor was in the actual show , and his performance was literally horrible and disappointing .
Another point is that with the help of technology we can communicate with the whole world .
We always want to know about others ' lives , especially the famous ones , even the ones that we hate .
Now , I have two questions about camping .
The best thing was speaking in English because I was forgetting it , and I met my favorite singer .
Well , I would only be available in July , because at that time I would be on winter vacation .
I am looking forward to the meeting with you and working together during the conference .
One can get to the city center with the No.456 bus , and then proceed on foot to the castle .
One night , I heard a strange sound .
It all comes from my parents .
But this problem is solving itself .
Thank you for everything .
The next morning as Pat was going to school , he met Bad Jon and told him , " Hey , you .
The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous .
We thought that we could change the program this way : we could go to the Science Museum Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
You certainly saw that the plays and films had a lot of success .
So , she asked me to fill her position .
Shopping is when a human goes to the store and buys what they want . However , I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes and all sorts of things .
In the past , everything was very different .
I have just two questions .
The aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco Resort building which was built 10 years ago . It is one of the first buildings that was built with the latest technology by an important Mexican architect .
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
You also asked me about two activities .
I also wanted to know if I have to take some money to buy souvenirs and food or will that be paid for me too ?
Lastly , I have questions about clothes and money .
I 'm very happy to know that I have won first prize .
Thank you very much .
Second , if you happen to forget something , you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers , and that can take up even more time .
Before , I did not know how to use the internet .
How has modern technology changed our daily life ?
It was so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice .
Indeed , instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , we had amateur actors .
Of course , if everyone paid less attention , the situation would be better .
It was an absolutely fantastic prize .
I am a representative of our class writing to you at your college .
The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines . Today 's children must be introduced to computers from an early age so that they have a chance to compete with their furious emergence in the future .
When I saw your advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have a perfect evening , as you have written on your advertisement .
In addition , it would be nice if you could send me an address of where I am going to stay so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family .
Admission for students is free .
I also would like to mention your concerts .
I ca n't go downtown in big cities .
Finally , I must choose traveling there in July because I am not allowed to take a vacation in other months due to my work .
I 'm really happy to hear from you !
Actually , I 've only done light and sound for drama day at my school at the end of last term .
Yesterday as I was arriving home , I saw him in your yard , Mack . He looked very satisfied . Curly was lying on the grass and ... "
I also choose climbing .
Afterwards , I decided to go for a meal in the theater restaurant , but it was closed .
I will be expecting to hear from you .
His acting was not good and he did n't seem to like acting . Even my son could act better .
Now , my dream will come true .
I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events at the Circle Theatre 's " Over The Rainbow . "
All fashion passes in a couple of months and has to be created again .
Write to me soon and tell me if you want to join us for 2001 .
LAST WEEK , I HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH MY MOTHER .
I 've always enjoyed danger , and this time getting the password was , indeed , a tough cookie .
I am sorry for any inconvenience , and I am waiting for your reply .
I was just walking down by and the dressing room manager asked if I could help them .
The performances were great , but some halls were too small to accommodate all people there were that day .
At first , I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor , but he must have been changed since the actor was different .
It is very enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming .
Is it a very expensive area ?
I am pleased to have the opportunity to practice sports as well .
In my opinion , in the future people will wear clothes made of natural fabrics : silk , cotton , leather , wool .
I would like to travel in June , as I have already arranged for a part-time job later this summer .
Firstly , the actors were n't those announced .
What should I bring for the weather ?
What I realized was that they are not different from any of us , except for being called celebrities .
I know that I will have the chance to do two activities during this time .
Now I am happy to give you all the information you need .
Also , I prefer sleeping in a tent to in a log cabin because it is easier to clean .
We think and speak about it with our families .
My name is Paula and I 'm one of your recent visitors to your show " Over the Rainbow . " This is also the reason for my letter .
There are many historical buildings .
Guess who they chose for the work : me , yes me . I could n't believe it .
Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colors would be , I consider myself to have been very successful .
All of a sudden , a weird creature popped into his dream .
Technology changes daily life . It makes life easier and , of course , more comfortable with computers , televisions , radios , etc. , and sometimes more secure , like in medicine .
I was very happy because at this time I had a chance to talk to them and to know more about them .
Everybody is free to dress for the party but please be appropriate .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Amazingly , doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time ; shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains .
To be honest , the next great invention , the computer , would n't work if we did n't already have the phone .
At work , we have the most important thing in the world of technology : the computer , without which we ca n't do anything today .
According to the advertisement I have seen , it is supposed to show the latest fashions , leisure and sportswear , makeup and hairstyles .
I am fine , but quite busy because I have my German exams .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If I find something special to visit in three hours , I will call you .
I like to be around people , even if I do n't know them .
I would like to try it this time .
The first week was fine , but on the second week , I got very sick .
It was very sad news to Richard Brown .
During my vacation in London , I went to see your musical show .
I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving you the information that you have asked of me .
Secondly , I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kinds of music . But the main problem was that some concert halls were too small , and because of that , I could n't see one of the concerts in the program .
I got their address so we can visit them one day .
Technology is in every part of our lives .
Even though my parents do n't mind whether I go out at night or study , do n't think that living in my house is like living in heaven . I ca n't play the guitar , listen to loud music , or invite my friends for a Saturday night party .
I was among a few of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town .
We would be terribly grateful if you accepted our offer .
However , the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London , where the latest fashions will be shown .
NOBODY TOLD US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES , AND WE WANT YOU TO GIVE US BACK OUR MONEY .
Please give this your careful consideration .
Apart from this , the computer 's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to , while five years ago when I did not have a computer , I had to write letters , which was a slower way to contact people .
I just imagined what it was like to be a singer .
This is a very interesting question for us and may be very important too .
It was a kind of map that showed a place with a lot of money which robbers had hidden .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend you visit the historical museum !!!
Everyone at school was so jealous .
But you ca n't imagine who the singer was : it was Sting ! Can you imagine ?
Secondly , technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do many more things .
All of us must notice this fact .
Regarding the information that you requested , I must tell you that I will only be able to travel in July because I got a new job , and I ca n't ask for more than one month of vacation each year . During the other months , I will be very busy because my co-workers will take vacations during these months .
And also it is very interesting to talk with writers .
Both of them are convenient for getting there .
I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won and I am writing to you in order to give you all the details you need .
Finally , I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after the show , but it was closed because they were refurbishing the interior .
I arrived in Ireland on July 2nd .
I saw the musical show in your advertisement during my vacation .
However , it also can make us very lazy .
I am writing in order to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow . "
In the end , he wins ; but before he is able to get back , he has to " sacrifice " his fish to attacking sharks .
It was like a dream .
I really think it sounds so interesting .
I would like to go in July because I have set my vacation for this month since last January .
It is going to be very lovely and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises .
Unfortunately , it was used to kill a lot of people .
They were replaced by less famous actors .
This year , I started a private school in Dijon .
It is a famous exhibition , which shows latest fashion , leisure and sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles .
I feel free as an eagle .
I 've got other questions : What type of clothes do I have to bring ?
If that does not seem like enough , after the show my boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theatre 's restaurant but the unpleasant surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on vacation .
At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant , so people must have nice clothes ; jeans are not allowed .
In the end , I was happy that I had done this job .
At home , young people should help their parents with some housework .
Therefore , we should try to educate ourselves and respect everyone 's privacy .
You will understand how upsetting all this was . I decided to visit your restaurant , thinking that could save my visit to the theater , but it was closed , and I had to go back to my hotel feeling mad and hungry .
What I really want to discuss is my recent experience .
The party will finish quite late , so we 've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely .
So man has invented machines to help with certain tasks ; but nowadays , we are becoming slaves to them .
Next weekend I have an appointment with one of them , but I wo n't tell you the name because you 'll be jealous !
Firstly , I would like to travel in July because before then I do n't have time .
Neighbors have complained about loud music .
Some people think that going shopping can help with depression .
In regards to the work , I had to mostly make the concert stage with some co-workers .
People had completely different lifestyles .
Another thing I have to comment on is the time of the show .
Another sport I love is basketball .
On top of all this , the theater restaurant was closed , because the chef and the waiters were on vacation .
I think you do n't realize this until you 're not a part of the crowd .
We could listen for free !
It would be a great opportunity because , for students , it 's free .
They will hate the new thing because they have to miss a party .
I am writing from Paris , where I live .
I look forward to hearing from you soon and if you could send me the brochure for this vacation I would be grateful .
I still believe it was only a dream !
I never imagined I would have to face this situation .
There are many indispensable electrical appliances , such as the television , radio , fax machine , and microwave .
Fashion - its past , present , and future - is one of the most popular topics for people to discuss .
It was the very last day of my trip and I was in Kyoto .
I really recommend this book ; it is fabulous .
Clothes used to be made out of cotton , but nowadays we see shirts , pants , socks , etc. , made out of almost everything .
At the end of the conference , there is a party . It 's a perfect opportunity for your students to meet new friends from all over the world and speak about their experiences .
Firstly , I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing , as your advertisement already said , but there was a different actor instead of him that evening .
I am waiting for your reply .
I 'm writing to complain about your current musical show which I saw last week .
You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference ; it only takes ten minutes approximately .
As you know , I finished school two years ago .
I would like to travel in July because it is the only month that I will be able to take days off .
I would like to ask you what type of clothes should I bring ?
I mean , all the flashing lights , the changing colors - I believe they helped a lot .
In the winter , you 'll freeze .
It could be an advantage !
They will bounce down roads with their balloon clothes .
The second reason is the weather .
Yes , it is the TV .
How is your sister , Marine ?
On the other hand , I would like to request all details of the accommodation and if you could specify what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money to bring .
I also recommend window shopping .
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
The conference will be held in The Royal Hall , and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus .
We will pay Curly 's doctor with the money that we will earn , " Pat said .
Another thing was that the show I went to was supposed to start at 7 : 30 , but it started at 8 : 15 !
I am only allowed to take vacation in July .
Please , bring me with you , to your reality ! "
If I use e-mail it 's much easier and cheaper . And , I can send e-mail anytime .
I wish you all the best !
I prefer that kind of accommodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but I ca n't in a tent .
Because I 'll be very busy the first week of July , I 'd appreciate it if you can give me the choice to start my " Camp California " on July 10th .
" He is so bad .
In fact , there would be only one possibility in July , because I will end with my exams session at the end of this month and begin a practical training the 1st of August .
Therefore , I would like to have my money back .
Unfortunately your advertisement about it was n't true !
If you choose the post , you will be thoroughly exhausted at the end of the concert .
Can you believe that I helped on the last Britney Spears concert ?
Anyway , I think that 's it for now .
In my opinion , it would be interesting to film a sport class in order for our parents to realize that we improve our body 's abilities , and not just our brain 's abilities , at school .
Thank you very much for this . We will pay Curly 's doctor with the money that we will earn , " Pat said .
Could I suggest that you consider changing the program ?
Anything as a souvenir would be quite enough for me .
I have to add that the weekend ticket was ideal to see all the events .
I hope that is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July , when the company I work with suspends its activities .
But we have to accept that everyone has a private life . For example , when we get married or when policemen stop us on the highway , we do n't want strangers noticing what is happening to us .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
I really do n't know why she behaves so badly during her interviews .
I would prefer to stay in the tent cabin ; I think it is more comfortable .
It closed at 11 pm .
Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too is very enjoyable for me .
This is mostly because I have a job , and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months .
But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time .
I want you to know what extraordinary moments I had with my friends in the festival .
In the end , I would like to say that my evening out two days ago was not perfect , and I wold be glad if you could pay me back some money .
I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE GOOD .
Your refrigerator will tell you when you have to buy milk , eggs , or cheese .
I really got to know them after the concert .
From the list of activities I have chosen photography and golf .
Furthermore , sometimes you can not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low-quality product .
There are links between the greenhouse , technology , and me .
In the advertisement for the show , you said that one of the stars was going to be Danny Brook , but to my surprise , it was a different actor . It really disappointed me .
Today I can connect to the internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine .
During the afternoon , Tim and I spent the hours before the concert lying in the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held .
We saw an advertisement about the Fashion and Leisure Show .
However , I have some proposals about improving it next year .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
We bought the tickets , and then we sat down to rest .
Can you believe you can contact anyone from any country whenever you want ?
Pat went to Anna 's and she seemed really unhappy .
Therefore , people are used to shopping weekly or monthly .
So , I am going to choose golf and tennis .
Fortunately , it is not far from our college .
Believe it or not , I put make-up on one famous singer 's face .
They are filled with people who want to buy everything .
There is a storm , and they ca n't leave .
On the other hand and as a conclusion , I think that these developments have made my life more comfortable : living surrounded by lots of gadgets with different functions .
He kept forgetting his lines .
First of all , it would be good to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is the hottest month of the year , and the weather will be really nice .
It was our family 's secret .
I learned from your letter that I 've won the first prize .
We had been trapped in the snowy , almost vertical slopes of the " Tête Blanche " for more than ten hours .
It seems like ages since I wrote to you .
During my time in California , I would love to have the chance to do some leisure activities such as swimming . It is my favorite sport .
With this prize , I can choose two activities , ca n't you ?
Firstly , there was a different actor instead of the famous actor , Danny Brook .
In my opinion , staying in a log cabin is more fun and much cleaner .
I am not satisfied with your show , as it was completely different from the advertisement .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
On my third day , I helped them install the sound system .
Although the show was supposed to be London 's newest and best musical , I was rather disappointed with it .
First of all , the principal actor was not Danny Brook but a substitute ; and the theater had not notified the audience about this change beforehand .
I ca n't imagine if I had been caught .
Secondly , I thought the show would start at 7 : 30 , but it started at 8 : 15 .
We can take care of loved ones and give them more attention . Time is not really a problem .
That is why I would like to do that .
Well , it was the best time of my life !
However , the press should n't create rumors and hunt these people like animals .
If you have any time left , you ought to go to the High Street , where you could go shopping .
And it wears on their attitude towards life and on their character .
Students start their day at the gym , where they learn the importance of being fit . I suggest filming this activity .
I went to this festival with four friends , and we enjoyed our time very much .
I would also like some information about weather .
Your advertisement in the newspaper said " Starring : Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . "
Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills , making this a trip to remember .
And , the theater 's restaurant was being painted , so I could not go there as was advertised .
In the future , we wo n't buy clothes by size or even color ; our clothes will adapt to our body , the weather , and our necessities .
I mean , would £700 be enough for me for one week ?
Thank you very much for your letter from 1/6/00 . I was really amazed with the news that I 'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
You know , he is my favorite singer .
I was very disappointed !
Generally , when you go shopping with a friend or two , what you expect is to wander around and look at everything .
We 're waiting for your answer . Receive our greetings .
Do you know what , Kim ? I 've never thought about it before but enjoying yourself like this can be weird .
I am really surprised that I have won .
What do you think about that ?
But about differences between rich and poor homes , it will be the same in the future .
Luckily , I could keep my secret for a couple of days ; but then it became urgent , and I needed someone to talk to .
I did n't have my cell phone with me , and I was halfway between my school and home .
I thank you very much for hearing my request on behalf of all the students . I apologize for any inconvenience it could cause . I am certain you will think about a visit to " The London Fashion and Leisure Show . "
The party will be nice .
Firstly , I would like to mention that in daily life we all use some technological machines , like TV-sets , stereos , microwave ovens , and others .
If possible , we can interview the last winner .
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
Nonetheless , people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake .
I am looking forward to receiving your reply with my money .
The most important thing will be the figure , such as long legs or a pear-shaped body .
We were allowed to go out if we did n't want to stay in class .
I told you that I helped at a pop concert last month .
In regard to your International Arts Festival advertisement , I would like to express my pleasure at being part of the event and some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take in consideration .
All I have to do is buy and choose .
Firstly , I have to say that I can only travel in July this year .
I choose singing because I am embarrassed by my voice , so maybe I could improve it .
When I saw the advertisement of the show , it said that the show would start at a half past seven but started at a quarter past eight .
Afterwards , they talked to me and thanked me for helping them in those exciting moments .
Thirdly , the disappointment made me a bit hungry , but the restaurant was closed without any sign saying why .
We think that , if you do n't mind , we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
As you know , I am a member of a BSB fan club , and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live .
I think this will make your festival more popular .
Back in the 30 's , different governments invented guns , battleships , and all kinds of weapons for their armies .
That 's why I 'd like to ask for a refund .
Along with all the treasures , statues , and historical paintings , there are also restaurants and modern galleries .
In spite of our decadence , some cheap souls still have the courage to say that , by shopping , they 're filling their empty spaces .
The bus will be in service at 9.30 PM and 11.30 PM , and at the end of the party the last one will depart .
I was disappointed when I found out the actor was n't Danny Brook !
Consequently , I propose to change the program as follows : on Tuesday afternoon , instead of shopping , we could go to this show , and go shopping on Wednesday afternoon during our free time .
But while reading realistic stories , I fall deep into the story , into the writer 's world .
Hopefully , I will meet some other girls in the same sport so that we can play as a team .
I always dreamed about going to California , and now my dreams are coming true .
Do you want to join me ?
The computer is very useful and it has affected our lives in different ways .
It can show how much students are enjoying their life in our school .
We were there alone , my friend with his broken leg and myself .
They are able to give and receive information very quickly .
In this book , Heathcliff , as a child , did n't have a bad character ; but the situations he lived through with the Earnshaw family , where he grew up , made him rude , aggressive , and noisy .
The shopping center is right opposite of the hotel , however , so some people may want to just wait at the hotel , having a cup of coffee .
I hope you will consider my suggestion .
You do not have to waste money at all .
I must sign off as I want to catch the post .
That means , for example , while you are sitting in the office , you are able to control your home with the computer .
In my opinion , math , politics , Chinese , English , and painting are the most interesting classes .
So , I will be very happy to improve my art in the camp .
I have good singing skills too .
I SUGGEST THAT WE GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING , AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE , WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW .
First of all , I think that famous people deserve to have a private life .
We will be more understanding with others .
I 'm writing to you because during my stay in London , I went to the theater to see a musical show , and I had a very disappointing evening .
How is about an accommodation .
I could rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song . I saw a number of famous musicians nearby .
From the beginning of the century until now , modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier .
They are always expected to be beautiful , intelligent , and good-looking .
I was very excited when I could see a star !
So , I 've read Agatha Christie 's " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie . "
Believe me , shopping can also be painful .
So , staying in a log cabin will probably prevent a lot of problems .
In your previous letter , you asked for information about interesting buildings to visit in my country .
The school works together with known companies such as Marriott Hotels , Air France , and Princess Cruises among others in order to provide students with high - quality training .
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders , I knew I had to see it .
They ca n't communicate with ordinary children or attend ordinary schools .
I would like to travel in July because I am a student , and I only have vacation during that month .
The ticket for the show is included .
I 'm writing to you because I want you to refund me for " London 's newest and best musical show : Over the Rainbow , " presented in the Circle Theatre .
When I received your letter with photographs of the flat , it really looked nice .
Another thing is that there was n't any discount available , so we spent a lot of money on such a bad show .
The building is upgraded every year .
I have also been told that they 're going to make a music video from that concert , so I tried as well as I could .
In addition to that , realistic stories are more attractive . I personally do n't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents that I know ca n't be true .
I am excited and looking forward to going to camp there .
I am very delighted to visit Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks .
But I think I will choose basketball and photography because basketball is the only sport I can play well .
Moreover , students are allowed to enter for free .
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , but if there are no cabins left , I can stay in a tent as well .
I made two albums about birds and flowers .
I had to wait for 45 minutes while doing nothing .
I think it would be nice to invite somebody to sing so that the students can enjoy themselves and dance at the end-of-conference party .
Thank you for asking me about my taste and being concerned about it .
I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved , bad-tempered , and angry with the world for interfering in their lives .
I 'd like to change a rule at home .
I want to say thank you . I am the lucky person who won that competition .
After the show , I decide to have dinner in your theatre restaurant , but I could n't because it was closed .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
As for the accomodation , I would prefer to sleep in the tents , because I 've never been in one , and it is a lot more fun than log cabins .
Reading the gossips : do n't we all love to do it ?
This story happened a long time ago .
I hope my recommendations will help you choose a building to visit .
But when I went there , it was closed .
Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
I have taken a photography course and I enjoy taking photos of animals .
Some said math because it is practical and useful , but the majority said it is boring unless you choose a job which uses your math knowledge , as accounting ; otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer .
At 20 : 00 , we stopped at a coffee house to eat . They shouted , " At 20 : 30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave . "
I am looking forward to staying in contact with you .
I AM WRITING TO YOU IN ORDER TO REPLY TO THE KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU .
I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July .
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value because morality and principles are also involved .
Therefore , journalists should respect their lives and always write real news .
I went to the theatre last weekend to see " Over the Rainbow . "
I have something really exciting to share with you .
I start an Italian course in August , so it will be impossible for me to leave .
The show began late , much later than your advertisement states , at about 20 : 15 . The show started 45 minutes late .
By the way , I 'm wondering what kinds and how many clothes I should bring .
They just said , " We do n't give money back . "
Otherwise , if you are in a good mood , it will turn into a bad mood .
It 's a great opportunity because in our quickly developing world , we have to look fashionable , and this kind of show is quite rare .
Technology is the thing that makes our lives easy .
I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on April 5th is suitable for you .
But we had to wear a uniform , and we had to study a lot to pass the exams .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me about the two weeks I won at Camp California .
Thanks a lot for your letter .
Moreover , I practiced many aspects of my speciality , but for me the most important was real experience .
Technology is essential to our life ; we need it every minute , every second .
Regarding your questions , the following are my answers .
The starring actor had been changed . The show did n't start until 20 : 15 , and there were no discounts available .
So you will enjoy traditional foods , music , dances , and games from all over the world .
According to the advertisement , Danny Brooks would be starring , but it was a different actor .
A survey was done , and the issue was , which subjects ( lessons ) and activities the students think are the most enjoyable .
Well , I tried to do so , and the lady at the desk told me that there were tickets available at that price but that they were already sold out !
Military technology has affected our lives more than we think because most of the equipment we use was originally created by those people .
I was excited to have a close look at so many famous pop stars .
When the important day is coming , it tells me .
Paul was wondering whether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words , " I am glad to meet you , Paul . "
On the one hand , these people chose to become public people .
I would like to travel in July because it is the summer , and the weather is sunny ; also I am totally free during this month .
Also , we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which was advertised in the newspaper " Metro " yesterday .
I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying clothes .
It would also be very interesting to film the situation during the break . The smokers in the schoolyard , the buffet , and the other pupils , who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework .
Unfortunately , I will be able to go only in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for this month .
It will be very awful .
I love swimming and also have a scuba diving license .
Technology nowadays is something on everybody 's mind .
Are there any rules at school that upset you ?
My family loves him , and they support us .
And admission is free for students .
Maybe children will not have to go to school ; they will just stay in their rooms and study from their computers , some kind of on-line education .
Secondly , it was supposed to start at 19 : 30 but actually started at 20 : 15 . It was forty-five minutes late !
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future .
We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of famous people by the media .
Finally , I appreciate your organization and look forward to hearing about the next International Arts Festival .
All the students in my class are excited about one more thing .
It was n't a usual fish ; it was a Gold Fish and it asked him , like a human , " Please , let me go and I can do for you anything you want . "
You have to read it yourself . And , if your cousin likes crime stories , it is a perfect book !
However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March .
When I stay home I can watch or listen to the radio , etc. , so modern technology helps me to spend my free time .
As I explained , it was not the perfect evening I had expected , and I would like to get my money back for the reasons I mentioned before .
After the play , which turned out to be just as bad as I thought , I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant , but it was closed , and for no reason !
Even though I worked hard on it , I was very surprised to have won the first prize .
Almost everything is connected to computers , including education , researching the universe , and other things .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on March 14th in the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
Moreover , the play did not start at the time it was supposed to .
The reason I 'm choosing these two activities is that they are different from each other . I want one that 's more exciting and that requires agility and another that 's more calm and relaxing , that requires only my ability to paint .
We would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion , and we hope to hear from you soon .
There is sometimes an actual fight over who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician .
About two weeks ago , I went to London for a week-long vacation .
Also , they are showing their first play on the 2nd of July .
New technology wo n't improve the relationships between people .
Thus , realistic stories develop our imagination and creativity , which are essential .
It 's one of the most important things for me , to have a chance to forget about my present , luxurious life and try doing something different .
Another aspect is that children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention .
To begin with , in your letter you asked me when I would like to travel .
I am certain you will think about a visit to " The London Fashion and Leisure Show . "
I want to play tennis and go swimming .
MY NAME IS JAMES RAMIREZ , AND I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
I am writing this in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday .
Since I did n't expect to be successful , I am very happy about this result .
" What will clothes be like 100 years from now ? "
Each of us had a different task .
I think that they will have a similar structure , but they will include some new technological advances like having all the house computer controlled so that , for example , we can turn on the lights in the bedroom by just pressing a button while we are watching TV on the sofa .
What do you think about this plan ?
On the last day , I 'll go to your house and we 'll think about our conference plan .
Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .
I prefer to stay in a tent because it feels very natural .
On the other hand , if you think that you 'll be in the red , you 'd better stay at home .
People backstage , including me , were helping to clean up all the stuff and get ready for the end of the concert .
Mathematics teachers do a great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons .
Finally , I 'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience of my life .
It was not our fault that we went in after 11 pm .
I am really happy to receive the letter about Camp California from you .
We ca n't imagine our lives without them .
I realized that it was a different actor , instead of Danny Brook .
There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets , which appears to be wrong , too .
From the beginning , it was all a disappointment .
Most of them are flats which have at least 20 floors .
I 'm not such a young man , and during the past years of my life I have become accustomed to more comfort .
After a while , she pulled herself together and paused for a minute .
But on the other hand , I have never done surfing . I am a complete beginner , but I am dying to do it .
Fashion of the Future .
At the ticket office I also asked for a discount , but they told me this was n't possible . Your advertisement said clearly that there were discounts available !
I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included .
I would like to ask if you could expand the plays and films for next year .
After the show we went to the theater restaurant but it was closed .
It makes it possible to meet and talk with new people on the internet and also be joined by my friends and family .
I do n't have a clue about it .
I was thinking , " What should I do ? "
When I must buy something , I usually ca n't find it , and then shopping becomes a nightmare .
Finally , I would like to inquire how much money I should take with me , and also what kind of clothes would be most suitable to wear .
So I am very grateful to the person who invented it . Unfortunately , I have forgotten his name .
Finally , I would like to know what kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp , the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me , and if there is any cooking equipment to cook meals ourselves .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
The saleswomen are too busy and do n't have time to assist you .
It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight .
I do n't know why and I 'd like you to tell me .
We spent 2 weeks with the family .
They wanted to be famous , and they knew the price .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert , which I enjoyed helping at last month ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I 'm going to help them again .
Also , I would prefer to go swimming and surfing . I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool , so I am good at swimming .
In my opinion , shopping is just to cover our basic needs .
Every day , like everybody else , I watch TV , see international news , listen to the radio , play games on my computer , or communicate with American or Asian people without going out of my house .
I am one of your husband 's students .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Firstly , I helped to sell the tickets .
What is impressive about this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
Finally , could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes , towels , and extra money ?
It 's a good chance for you to improve your English .
Clothes are a part of each culture and one of the things which expresses our taste and personality .
It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment .
Regarding the end-of-conference party , I would suggest wearing a dress for women and an elegant suit for men , though it is not formal .
We have organized to do the party from three to six o'clock in the afternoon at the College Canteen . For food , we organized a buffet . But could you help us with the music ? What does he prefer , if he prefers something especially ?
I helped at a pop concert for a newcomer group , and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
It was necessary because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
I would also take an off-campus internship .
You were supposed start the show at 19 : 30 p.m. , but you started late at 20 : 15 p.m. without any explanation .
On my first day , I did n't work .
Styles mix ; colors and shapes come back from the past ; only the fabrics are different .
A friend of mine gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place .
Unfortunately , the musical show was annoying .
Last but not least , I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America .
The queue is not the only problem . If you go by car , there is the parking problem . If you go by bus , there is another queue , and you have to carry many bags during the your journey and you wo n't always be lucky enough to find a seat to sit down in .
But I 'm really happy that I had even a small role in helping people enjoy themselves .
I wish you had informed us beforehand .
The other one is the television .
As mentioned above , please take some time to give me more information , and if you 'd like to know more , please telephone me for further discussion .
We often go out to sing in karaoke bars .
I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have been paid .
Firstly , what kind of clothes do I have to take to the camp for hot or cold weather ?
I am not really satisfied with it .
First , what clothes should I bring ?
I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you were in New York on vacation .
Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not . Overall , it is not always enjoyable .
I did not get a discount .
I know you have good taste in presents !
It was said that it would start at 19 : 30 but it did not .
The group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is not very far from where the conference will be held .
I am very interested in going for two weeks to Camp California in the USA .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there are people from only six countries .
I am looking forward to traveling .
I am writing because my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Besides , the theater restaurant had closed down before I got out of the show .
Technology , are we prepared for these advances ?
However , we saw an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
A crowded hall is not good for enjoying music .
I have sung in the church 's choir for three years , and I have had singing classes in school since first grade .
50 years ago , Korean mothers had to make a fire by burning wood to warm up a room and cook .
So , I have some opinions on this , which I would like to tell .
Anyway , we still want to go to the Science Museum and shopping as well , but we think we can go shopping on the last afternoon of our trip .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The festival was very well organized with a lot of choices like concerts and dance shows .
Thank you very much for your letter . I was glad to get it and read a lot of news about you .
It would be appreciated if you could supply some towels , if possible .
I would prefer surfing or climbing , but I have to think of my health .
I was very surprised when I saw that singers are n't as sophisticated and self-confident as they are portrayed in the newspapers .
What is it that we use every day for many hours , sometimes from early in the morning until late in the evening ?
I think if we wear these clothes , we will travel every where easier than we use cars , ships , planes , and spaceships .
In the future , it will be able to help people even more , since it has been increasing its capacity day after day .
To sum up , I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent , reasonably-priced tickets like this year .
The other bad point was the starting time . It was already 20 : 15 when the first star entered the scene , but your advertisement said 19 : 30 !
People also use telephones in their personal life , for example , when you want to talk to your family or friends who live far away .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology .
I received your letter this morning and I was very surprised .
You can not only listen to her best detective stories , but also learn English automatically .
The only problem is that on April 4th , I have my graduation .
Modern technology has changed my daily life from physical activity to mental activity .
But the problem is that when I want to buy only one thing , like bread , on Friday evening and on weekdays , every supermarket is crowded .
The activities are quite hard to choose , really , because you have a lot of choices , which I like .
Finally , I would like to ask you for some more information about the clothes and money we will need .
Another problem was that I thought that discounts were available ; however , there were n't any .
She is very intelligent .
What we did was make many cups of coffee and help find their missing socks and other clothes .
We can love them without disturbing .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Instead of going shopping , we could go to the show .
Along with these improvements and comforts , I ca n't stop thinking where all of this will lead us .
In every country there are the famous people who are in the the public eye .
In addition to this , it will be a great opportunity for all of us , because for the students it is completely free .
In conclusion , I think that people who are too interested in other people 's lives do n't have an interesting life and are unhappy !
First of all , could you let us know if the date of June 16th is all right with his timetable program ?
What do you think about going to visit the Arts Museum ?
In 1874 , Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city ( a small town near Savannah ) .
I learned painting when I was a student .
Consider getting a bigger one for next year because these kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people .
Its first use was to listen to concerts if you were not able to attend it in person .
Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with reasonably-priced tickets for the whole weekend .
When I was a child , I always wanted the lyrics of the songs that I liked , but it was nearly impossible to get them .
So when I read about other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught , I got very angry and annoyed .
On the other hand , I would like to point out that the festival would appeal to more people if a few improvements were made .
This is an experience I 'll never forget .
Apart from all that , after of the musical , I went to your Theatre Restaurant to have dinner because I had left home without eating , so I was hungry at that time .
It closed at 10 pm , but the show finished at 10 : 30 pm .
First of all , I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook , but sadly he was n't there , a different actor filled in , who was rather disappointing .
We lived in a rush , but there was a lot of fun , too .
If I want to buy a nice pair of shoes , I have to go into a city center and browse around from shop to shop until I find the shoes I like .
However , I have never tried to surf .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
If the door it is broken , we can replace it rapidly and inexpensively .
Well , I think that almost everything in future homes will be automatic and do what people say .
I always had my own key and unlocked the door myself .
The invention which has been most important to me is the personal computer .
I am writing to tell you about my experience in last month 's pop concert , where I was helping my friend Nick , who was the bouncer of the place .
Suddenly a murder happens !
I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions !
In your advertisement , you announced that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Moreover , once I was going to pay for the tickets , I found another thing : there were no discounts available .
When I needed information , I had to go to the library to find it in books or newspapers .
I am looking forward to your reply .
Without a doubt , the invention of the computer is the most important technological event .
Or , without leaving the office , you will be able to heat water for a hot bath .
I was so disappointed .
I am writing to you in order to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival .
BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORST THING. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTIES OF WORKING IN THE THEATER .
Your advertisement says ' discounts available ' but they were not available .
I am able to meet friends quickly on the internet by just clicking the mouse .
Maybe I should say in a flat instead of a building .
Last May , I had a week 's vacation in London , and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for " OVER THE RAINBOW , " the MUSICAL SHOW .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
They are famous , but I think they need to be alone sometimes .
It looked at me and spoke .
The director of the college has suggested we wear smart clothes for the occasion , and I give you the same advice .
They also took me to an after - hours party and they asked me if would like to do this again .
I prefer to stay in a log cabin . Due to the fact that my children have summer vacation in July , I 'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog .
I would rather type coursework than handwrite it .
Firstly , I found that there were no discounts as was announced in the advertisement .
It 's like a joke but a bit scary .
I let this pass , and I bought it anyway , thinking that it was possible that it was just a mistake in your advertisement .
If it is possible , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollen .
I recently visited an arts festival , organized with your help .
Or can we find places to buy it ?
Also , I 'd like to join the activities of swimming and singing .
Finally , I helped them . In return , I had a good experience and enjoyed listening to music .
I had no doubt she would never , ever look at me again .
We have to think about it this way .
Where 's the fun in that ?
I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances .
During break time , I did give a lot of directions to people who could n't find the restrooms , as well as information such as where they could have a cup of coffee .
The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer .
If not , you can go on Saturdays , but there are too many costumers . You ca n't move or try on clothes ; it 's very hot .
It was really great .
I hope you enjoy your trip to our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference .
The show finished late .
I look forward to seeing you .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
Probably , because their parents do n't have enough time to go out of the city and show them nature .
The Barbican Centre was built in 1975 . Apart from Banks and important offices .
I now write with pleasure to give you further information about myself .
These things provide me with every convenience .
I have given much information on the international student conference .
So , in fact , people 's homes will become more convenient and more comfortable .
Finally , could you tell me how far it is to the nearest town or village ?
Is it warm enough ?
On top of this , we intended to go to the theater restaurant , which was closed because of building activities .
Lastly , it could be nice for students who are interested in arts to have special events , for instance , a song contest , a writing competition , or dance lessons .
Even though I had planned something else to do , I agreed because she 's my very good friend .
From my point of view , homes of the future will be very similar to homes that we have today .
First , I 'll tell you the name of the hotel : it 's the Palace Hotel .
It has been so long since I last wrote to you ...
Anyway , I 'll tell you about my wonderful experience at a pop concert .
Nowadays it 's obvious that designers sell only details , but significant changes do n't turn up .
This event was not what I call " a perfect evening out , " as your advertisement promised .
The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting everyone with BB guns .
The biggest disadvantage is pollution .
In addition to this , the show did not start on time , 19 : 30 , so I had to wait for 45 minutes .
The designer will have a lot of ideas about how to make very nice and useful clothes .
To begin with , the actor you publicized was going to perform did n't perform .
I think it was the water .
I am really looking forward to taking part in Camp California .
The machine used to read this card was so big the computer needed a room of its own .
The end-of-conference party is designed to give a rough idea about many different cultures .
There , we will have the chance to be made up or to try new hairstyles .
Since the London Fashion program takes place on Tuesday , I would suggest we change your plan .
I immediately said " yes , " as did my friend .
I understand you want to know when I 'm available and where I 'd like to stay .
At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed , so I ran to my brother to explain to him what I had seen .
She will come to Liverpool next week , and I 'll put her up .
I am writing to complain about a musical show I went to one week ago .
It includes a wide range of activities , for example , sightseeing , a river trip , visiting the science museum and gallery , and shopping .
I feel entitled to compensation for this event .
Thank you for organizing the trip to London .
Secondly , could you make arrangements for me to stay in a log cabin ? It seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents .
The most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE .
If there are , please tell me .
Pat told him that I was in love with him .
Perhaps there will be personal computers which will control everything , every item of furniture , light , temperature .
It was unbelievable , and tiring , as well .
Last but no less important is the class called " know-how , " which shows students how to cope with unexpected problems even when under stress .
I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring .
I am writing to share information about a very interesting building to visit .
I hope I 'll be able to travel in July . I prefer to stay in a log cabin . Due to the fact that my children have summer vacation in July , I 'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog .
I hope we can join the next pop concert together as staff and enjoy our time !
So you see my point .
I hope this is n't offending you too much ...
Thank you very much for many interesting places in this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are sure , will be very exciting .
I know , they are not like us .
In general , the rules at private schools are much stricter than the ones at state schools .
All the rubbish , dust , dirty dishes , plates , and caps will be washed and cleaned automatically .
" You see , I am a mere product of your mind , but I would like to get out of the Heavy Sleep .
The restaurant should have been open when I came out , but it was closed because of the hour the show finished .
I am just coming back from a week 's vacation in London , which has been , all in all , really nice .
Let me know if you are going to come so that I can prepare the bedroom for you .
Also , we are fascinated by their marriages , children , holidays , etc .
The people who were there to watch the show were very hungry and they were shouting because they were waiting for so long . I absolutely agree with them .
You can enjoy your time spending all your money on clothes , jewelry , furniture , etc. ; you can have a really great time .
But the positive way new technology has changed my life is in a way to communicate .
Firstly , I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment at your musical show , but that was not the case .
I 'm waiting for your reply .
I would also like to know more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which will be necessary for me to take .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
You should review the advertisements you make because you give out false information .
However , we saw an advertisement , and we are keen on the idea of going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Her boyfriend , Guy Richie , was there too , and he 's a really good person .
I wanted to come at 19 : 30 , because it is better at night and it would n't finish late ; but the show started at 20 : 15 and we got bored waiting for it to start .
Communications move the world . Famous people use them to improve their work , politicians for their campaigns , and film stars to make their latest movie famous .
It 's no wonder that people are starting to worry more about pollution in the world .
A couple of weeks later , my sister called me while I was at work , completely devastated and weeping scalding tears ; she could hardly pronounce a word .
To get from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St . James College , where the conference will take place .
Anyway , you wanted to know about my job .
We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place during our visit to London , the 14th of March .
And it 's not stopping . I hope that when I 'm in my thirties I 'll go to Mars for vacations ...
At the end of the summer we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia .
This is a precise letter that I write you now .
There are some things I would like to ask : the type ( and quantity ) of clothes I should take and whether it is necessary to take some money or any additional things ( like raincoats ) .
Everything is easier now .
So , we would be grateful if you can give us an opportunity to see the show .
Another important thing is that , despite the number and quality of films , there were , from my point of view , not many plays .
My job was very easy . I had to help Sting with everything ; for example , if he wanted water , I had to give to him water . It was marvelous .
Thank you for your answer .
But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt whether or not to use it . Especially now , when " big-mouth " Pat spread the news to literally everyone .
In this field , you have to offer new technology every day .
When the play " Over the Rainbow " ended , I tried to eat something , but the fact was that the theater restaurant was closed because your personnel were cleaning the mess that an old dog had made .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work ; my current post finishes at the end of June , but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
First of all , I recommend you go on the 8 a.m. boat .
In my opinion , technology has made human life easier , funnier , and more comfortable .
Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
She 'll probably come with a friend ; if you want you can join us .
Technology allows us to have more time for distractions or to do other things we really like .
A home made out of plastic , with windows made out of plastic so that we can have it for a long time .
He / she can just press a button or send an e-mail to operate what he / she needs , even when far from home .
I am writing to express my disappointment with the play " Over the Rainbow , " which is performing at Circle Theatre .
It was n't very pleasant .
That way , I can prepare suitable clothes .
So , I wanted to know if there will be more films next year .
Every person in the world looks to technology everyday to improve the way they live their own life .
It is good to remind ourselves to speak correctly .
But , sometimes I ask myself if the " ancient world , " without science , technological discoveries , and industries , was more authentic than ours .
As far as singing , I think I 'm quite good because I have been in my school 's choir for 3 years .
I said " yes , " and I am sure it was the best decision of my life .
I especially like watercolor painting .
I appreciate these shops because they have lots of products , cheap prices , and lots of space .
Also , it is expensive , and I ca n't afford to stay there too long .
Here is the information you asked me for .
It also changed free time . They have invented great games like PlayStation , and you can have a really good time with your friends playing .
Actually , they came from only six countries .
I was really disappointed by the other actor 's performance .
That way , we could get into places like NASA University .
All of them were shocked by what they heard . They started to talk about it everywhere .
It is a good start to go sightseeing by bus on Monday morning . We can see all of the famous buildings in a few hours .
Personally , I do n't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops , so I buy what I can using " on-line " services .
Finally , it was a very nice day and great experience .
I think that if we mix lessons with sports activities , the combination will give us complete success .
I 'm sure we can find another solution .
I do n't like thinking about my house , or my life , without all these facilities . In winter , when it gets dark very early , I have to spend my free time inside .
One story is about ten people who stay in a hotel on a lonely island .
However , I distance myself from my family and other people and have virtual relationships .
I hope you enjoy it .
I helped set up the sound equipment , program the light system on the computer , and tidy up Madonna 's room !
We prepared some special attractions like live dance music and hot or cold buffet .
I was very surprised at the result of the competition .
He actually went to Carla and told her everything .
As you can see , most of the offered activities in the advertisement were not provided .
I 'm very happy and lazy at the same time .
For example , the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor , but he was not .
This could save a life !
Although I wish that my accommodation at Camp California be in a tent , I got to experience that last summer .
I would ask you to refund my money .
I think it was very clever of me to record that moment which I will never , ever forget , and that was the thing that I most liked about that experience .
Based on everything listed above , I would like to be refunded the £10 I paid .
Unfortunately , it could have a disadvantage for me because of pollution from cars and factories .
Furthermore , the show started at the wrong time .
During the party , everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers of the conference .
It changes everyday , and I do not know if we will be able to understand it .
Then , by some " strange power " my left foot was moving , and I wanted to stop it , but it was too difficult .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT. 10 MINUTES AFTER I STARTED FOLLOWING HIM , I KNEW THE PLACE , AND I FELT MORE COMFORTABLE .
After waiting a while in this uncomfortable seat , the show started . I waited 45 minutes , and then the actors appeared , but I realized that the main one was n't Danny Brook ; it was an impostor .
We know what you have done and your dog will be sold . "
However , I must say , it was quite the opposite .
Who could imagine life without the telephone ? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
Well , that would be all .
The purpose of this letter is to let you know my opinion of the event .
Last month , I helped at a pop concert . It was marvelous .
Fortunately , the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones .
It is very useful .
To make matters worse , I had expected some discount for the ticket , but when I went to the ticket office , there was not any discount available .
By choosing this style of life , they should have realized what their life would look like .
I did n't get involved that much in writing the script because it was very hard , and the director wrote most of it , but the main idea for the stage background was mine , and I am very proud of it .
Is there only one teacher for each sport , and how many are in each group of activities ?
" Yes , Oh Lord , he did it because we beat his team at football , " Nick said .
I am very good at playing basketball .
First of all , I wo n't be able to travel until July because I have not finished school .
Also , in the advertisement , you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't . You also wrote that people could visit the theater restaurant after the show , to eat something or to have a drink .
In conclusion , if you shop reasonably , have a good time .
There are many sources of light in this world , such as sunlight , moonlight , and candlelight .
Now then , this advertisement was completely different . I am really disappointed with your musical . I am asking you for my money back because I did n't enjoyed your musical .
Modern technology has changed my daily life in many ways .
I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends .
I go to the swimming pool twice a week , so I am good at this sport .
When I was younger , I remember that when I had to study or work on a school project , I would take a lot of time researching in libraries , looking for old books .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
From my point of view , homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is connects every machine , TV , stove , and lights to the owner .
So they can also be just ordinary people .
When you work in an office , a factory , or an organization , you have the same schedule as them . So , you can only go shopping during your lunch break .
My name is John , and I went to the latest International Arts Festival .
As I told you in my last letter , I worked in Edinburgh two weeks ago helping at a pop concert .
I went to the " International Arts Festival " on November 21-22 .
I was really excited about seeing that show .
I am willing to show you the autograph and the photograph .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I 've never been to California , so please let me know about the weather there .
Shopping is great when you have lots of money and time ; you can buy clothes , shoes , make-up , a CD ... whatever .
Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed until 20 : 15 .
When you take classes on computer programming , you will definitely need one and this holds true for classes on politics , because you have to study statistics on your computer , do social research , and some analysis .
Please send me a list of the items I many need while there , including the most appropriate clothes for the American weather .
I was terribly disappointed .
A cellular phone can be inconvenient sometimes . But it can be very useful in certain situations : when your car is broken down on the road , when you need to be found anywhere and at any time ( if you are a doctor , a lawyer or a journalist , for instance ) , etc .
To make things even worse , the play did n't start at 7 : 30 as it was supposed to , but instead started 45 minutes late , at 8 : 15 . Even your famous discounts were n't available .
I choose singing because I love singing , and I have been in a choir for 7 years now .
I am writing in response to this .
At the camp , I would like to choose two activities : painting and singing . I love painting ; in the university , I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint because I work in a bank , and I have a baby .
I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday , March 14th at 10 : 00 - 19 : 00 .
As well as this , the stories are going to be read in English .
I am writing to provide you with the information you require .
Regarding the activities while at the Camp , I would enjoy swimming , not because I am good at it , but because I 'm keen on it . The other one will be photography .
So try to imagine my situation . I had paid a lot of money , and I did n't see a good show . I am really disappointed .
There is one thing I would like to ask you . It 's about how much money I will need to go out at night , to spend on food , and that kind of thing .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing .
I 'm writing to express my feelings and opinions about the International Arts Festival , which was held a few days ago .
I am writing to complain about the musical show I saw last Friday in your theater .
Also , you can spend hours trying to decide between wonderful blue trousers or a beautiful black dress .
It depends on every individual to change your mind and act as a " smart " shopper .
It starts in the morning when we wake up to the sound of an alarm clock ; in the bathroom , we have running hot water ; the whole house is warm due to central heating .
Finally , my parents are always arguing about different solutions to my problem , and this is all thanks to Pat .
I am writing to complain about your musical show .
Maybe you will spend all your money on a new thing , and a few hours later , your best friend will invite you to go to a nightclub , but you are short on money .
I think I would prefer climbing and painting .
I have chosen painting and photography .
Should I bring my camera , warm clothes , or any pocket money ?
I could be interested in your letter .
The pop group was all young people ( between 23 - 30 years old ) , and all of them were really nice .
During the whole day , I speak with the majority of my colleagues by telephone or e-mail .
I 'm writing you after visiting your theater last night .
One day , while all their friends were there and talking , Pat told everyone that Pandora had committed a robbery .
Thank you very much for your letter .
But also , there are some things that you should improve in next year 's festival to make it absolutely wonderful .
By the way , I 've understood that I had better trust in nobody .
How much money do I have to bring ?
First of all , I would like to say that it started later than it should . I had to wait for about forty-five minutes .
We have to face it - it has two sides .
I also think housewives will get help from robots .
The differences between male and female will be not important for clothes in 100 years time .
I had to wait all that time in the street , because the hall was not big enough .
You asked me about my experiences .
What do you want more ?
Your dance shows are very beautiful ; your art exhibitions are original and exciting .
I am very glad that I won first prize in your competition and I get to go to the United States .
The restaurant should stay open until the show ends .
If you have more questions about the conference or anything else , do not hesitate to ask me .
Although the jazz , rock , and classical music were great , some concerts and halls are too small . You could consider making them bigger next year .
For accommodation , I would prefer a tent , as I love nature , and I like camping a lot .
And what is the weather like ?
Lastly , the restaurant which was supposed to be opened was , in fact , closed without a reason !
I 'm writing to you regarding the radio program next Saturday where " The old man and the Sea , " by Ernest Hemingway , will be read .
My daily life should be changed by these innovations !
The organizer of the concert asked my school for about 15 people who do art to help decorate the stage .
I CAN NOT EXPRESS HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PRIZE .
One of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle class . Our school is now the best in the country in all ages . We are impressive in this , and we can show what we do in order to be the best .
But she did ; she asked me out .
People have seen over the last 10 years how different our clothes have become .
For the activities , I would like to choose tennis , which I am not too bad at , and climbing , which I have never done but must be interesting .
And , of course , the furniture in people 's home will not change either .
After the show , we went immediately to the ticket office to ask for our money back , but they were too strict and closed-minded .
It was a big mistake to tell her a secret , especially an important one .
With the help of modern technology , our daily life will not be so difficult .
That always happens , does n't it ?
We imagine that will be the best vacation of our lives .
They started charging down the field towards the fire , and once in range , everyone threw their balloon as far as they could .
Moreover there were not any discounts and all of the tickets were the same price .
I sometimes want to hear their voices on the telephone .
The reason for this is global warming , which is the solution to the problem and another reason why this idea is possible .
I also helped with the selling of the tickets , with the security , with the designing ...
In addition , the resort has an interesting architectural background , and the best facilities and activities that you can get in Mexico . For example , it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico .
On the other hand , during my stay in Camp California , I want to go swimming because I practice this activity regularly , and I often compete . This is one of my hobbies .
It would be meaningful to me to take part in your camp .
I really look forward to receiving your reply soon .
Another aspect is that people save time by using a telephone .
In my opinion , there should be a rule which lets the media approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private homes , leaving them at least one place to feel safe .
To sum up , it is a big school where you have a lot of interesting classes and some optional activities to do in your free time .
First of all , we are happy to win the first prize in your competition .
I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan .
Choosing gives me so much pleasure because I never have to worry where I get money for my wishes .
I would like to ask you about money and clothes .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July because I only have two months of vacation , which are July and August . I chose July because it is the only month that I think I 'm free .
In conclusion , I wanted to say thanks for such a special weekend .
Do you know Radiohead ?
Also , they will be able to create a special climate for each room .
Another point is the time that it started exactly 45 minutes later .
Regarding accommodation at Camp California , I would like to stay in a tent .
As you look around , everybody has a car or motorcycle .
I hope you will understand my disappointment and the reasons why I am asking for my money back .
But , on the other hand , people will still have to program them , as they have to do nowadays .
I was wondering what kind of clothes we need . And , what about money and meals - are they provided ?
Finally , we should film lunch , which is also a moment to relax for the students and the teachers . We must n't forget to film the teachers ' room because if a school is made of students , it 's also made of teachers .
The tickets were a little expensive , but I was with TEN other people , so when we read " Discounts Available , " we expected that the theater had organized a special discount for large groups .
The two activities I have chosen are basketball and tennis .
So , what are we going to do ?
If only I could sing beautifully !
However , you changed actors without informing viewers .
In addition , I would like to point out the success of the weekend ticket , due to its economical price and convenience .
First of all , I would like to travel in July due to my work commitment .
I 'm looking forward hearing from you .
When the band started to play , lots of girls started to jump . The fans were getting very close to them . Some of the girls started to take their clothes off , which was the best part for me , but security guards came and took them away .
It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy . Stores have plenty of all kinds of things .
Secondly , there were some problems with space in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small .
We have seen your program and we like everything , especially the Science Museum . It will be good for us to increase our knowledge and so on .
In the future , they will both get closer and closer .
Last , I have no experience abroad , so I 'd like to know about the weather in California in July .
To conclude , in this short video we must show that , thanks to our school , we are able to make the best of ourselves .
Both of them are my favorite sports , and I 'm quite good .
Did you know that this concert will be on television ?
It is very good , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class would enjoy .
I am very happy to learn that I won the prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A .
When the show started , the person who was in it was not Danny Brook , and he seemed not to be an actor .
It is well known in almost all families , often with a lot of different channels .
Hey , listen guys , we will take his dog which he loves very much , and we will sell it to Sally who wants one .
First , I was assigned to sell tickets .
After that , a being climbed out of the potato .
Her family was very rich , and a lot of men wanted to marry her .
But there 's something that I 'd like to ask .
It will take place on Tuesday , March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall from 10 : 00 to 19 : 00 .
As you know , I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents ' house . But that Sunday , I was driving , when suddenly , I saw in the lay-by an excellent car : It was a Jaguar with Will Smith in it . I stopped and I asked if he needed some help and he said " of course . "
My name is Sandra Atos . I am writing to you because this last weekend I went to the theater you manage to see what was called " London 's newest and best musical show . "
Nowadays we have different kinds of clothes that maintain body temperature , and clothes that do n't get wet or even dirty .
He fought in the Spanish Civil War and in World War II , always searching for answers to questions like : " What defines a man ? " or , " What happens to us in critical situations ? "
To sum up , the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group .
So , you can see that it was not as perfect an evening for me as I thought .
It is my favorite group .
I received your letter last Monday .
However , it was closed for cleaning .
Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money -- usually much more than we expect .
I am finishing my studies in June ; then I have a month off ( July ) , and on August 1st , I start a new job .
It 's brilliant , is n't it ?
This is important for everybody and I think this is important for them , too .
They said that it was n't necessary , so we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenery was being prepared for the concert .
Thank you for choosing our ticket in the final .
Her daughter , Lourdes Maria , is such a pretty little girl . I could n't take my eyes off of her .
I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year .
Now I am 16 , and I have a nice baby boy .
It seems incredible , but it 's normal for us .
Actually , it was terrible and I would like to have my money back .
How 's your new flat ?
This is very stressful .
After that I prepared the group .
I would like to thank you for first prize .
Most of all , I 'm so happy that I could choose some activities .
And as new discoveries lead to more discoveries , progress goes faster and faster .
