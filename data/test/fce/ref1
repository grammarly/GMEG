It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
First of all , you said that the star would be Danny Brook , but it was not .
I think it 's a great opportunity because we will have a chance to see the latest fashions in leisure and sportswear , as well as how to do the perfect makeup and hairstyles .
But to solve this problem , we may think first about its origin ...
The computer was invented 30 years ago , or more , and it began by processing information with big cards , which were perforated with small holes , and each hole meant something , like a code .
First , we will use new technologies like telecommunications or the internet more often .
If people want to enjoy shopping , we must consider before buying something - " do I really want it " ?
As a teenager , I must admit , that there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping .
I think if you have lots of money and do n't know what to do with it , do not go shopping - give the money to charity . That is better than shopping .
You can choose the price most suitable for you .
As modern technology is changing the world rapidly , I think we are all involved in the revolution it 's causing .
Also , the ticket discounts were not available .
I hope you will find my letter of interest , and I look forward to seeing you .
That was not what your advertisement had shown .
Food and beverages will be available .
I hope that my advice will help you .
Thank you for your attention .
After working 30 minutes , a singer appeared .
First , despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook would be starring , another actor starred in the actual show and his performance was literally horrible and disappointing .
Another point is that with the help of technology we can communicate with anyone in the whole world .
We always want to know about others ' lives , especially the famous ones , even the ones that we hate .
Now , I have two questions about camping .
The best thing was that I spoke in English because I forgot I was doing it , and I met my favorite singer .
Well , I would only be available in July , because at that time I would be on winter vacation .
I look forward to meeting with you and to working together during the conference .
One can get to the city center with the No.456 bus , and then proceed on foot to the castle .
One night , I heard a strange sound .
It all comes from my parents .
But this problem is solving itself .
Thank you for everything .
The next morning as Pat was going to school , he met Bad Jon and told him , " Hey , you .
The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous .
We thought we could change the program this way : we could go to the Science Museum Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
You certainly saw that plays and films had a lot of success .
So she asked me to fill her position .
Shopping is when humans go to shop and buy what they want . However , I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes and all sorts of things .
In the past , everything was very different .
I have just two questions .
The aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resort building , which was one of the first to be built with the latest technology 10 years ago , and designed by an important Mexican architect .
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
You also asked me about two activities .
I also wanted to know if I need to take some money to buy souvenirs and food , or will that be paid for , too ?
Lastly , I have questions about clothes and money .
I 'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize .
Thank you very much .
Secondly , if you happen to forget something , you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers , and that can take up even more time .
Some time before , I did not know about the internet .
How has modern technology changed daily life ?
It is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice .
Indeed , instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , we had average actors .
Of course , if everyone paid less attention , the situation would be better .
It was an absolutely fantastic prize .
I am writing to you as the representative of our class to your college .
The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines , so today 's children must be introduced to computers from an early age , so that they can have a chance to compete with the furious emergence of the future .
When I saw your advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have a perfect evening , as you wrote about in your advertisement .
In addition , it would be nice if you could send me an address where I will be staying , so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family .
The admission for students is free .
I also would like to talk about your concerts .
I ca n't go to the center of town in a big city .
Finally , I must choose to travel in July because I am not allowed to take vacations in other months due to my work .
I 'm really happy to hear from you !
Actually , I 've only done light and sound on drama day at my school at the end of last term .
Yesterday , as I was arriving home , I saw him in your yard , Mack . He looked very satisfied , Curly was laying on the grass , and ... "
I also choose climbing .
Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theater restaurant , but it was closed .
I will be expecting to hear from you .
His acting was not good , and he did n't seem to like acting . Even my son could act better .
Now my dream will come true .
I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events at the Circle Theater 's " Over The Rainbow . "
Everything in fashion fades away in a couple of months and has to be created again .
Write to me soon and tell me if you want to join us for 2001 .
LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUEMENT WITH MY MOTHER .
I 've always enjoyed the challenge and this time getting the password was , indeed , a tough cookie .
I apologize for any inconvenience . I am waiting for your reply .
I was just walking down by the dressing room when the manager asked if I could help them .
The performances were great , but some halls were too small to accommodate all the people that there were that day .
At first , I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor , but he must have been substituted since the actor was different .
It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming .
Is it a very expensive area ?
I am pleased to have the opportunity to practice sports as well .
In my opinion , in the future , people will wear clothes made of natural fabrics like silk , cotton , leather , and wool .
I would like to travel in June as I have already arranged for a part-time job later this summer .
Firstly , the actors were n't those announced .
Should I bring clothes to match the weather ?
What I realized was they were not different from any of us , but they were called celebrities .
I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time .
Now I am happy to give you all the information you need .
Also , I prefer sleeping in a tent than in a long cabin because it is easier to clean .
We think and speak about it in our families .
My name is Paula , and I 'm one of the most recent visitors to your show , " Over the Rainbow '' , which is the reason for my letter .
Many historical buildings remain .
Can you guess who they chose for the work ? Me , yes me . I could n't believe it .
Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colors was , I consider myself to have been very successful .
All of a sudden , a weird creature popped into his dream .
Technology changes our daily lives , it makes our lives easy to live , and of course , more comfortable , with computers , televisions , radios , etcetera , and sometimes more secure , like with medicine .
I was very happy because this time I had a chance to talk to them and to get to know them better .
Everyone is free to dress up for the party , but be considerate of appropriateness .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Amazingly , doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time : shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains .
To be honest , the next great invention of people , the computer , ca n't work if you have n't got a phone .
At work we have the most important item of technology in the world , the computer . Without that we ca n't do anything these days .
According to the advertisement I have seen , it is supposed to show the latest fashions , leisure and sportswear , and makeup and hairstyles .
I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If I find something special to visit in three hours , I will call you .
I like to meet people I do n't know .
I would like to try a tent this time .
The first week was fine , but on the second week I got very sick .
It was very sad news for Richard Brown .
During my vacation in London I went to see your musical .
I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by providing the information you have asked for .
Secondly , I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kinds of music , but in this case , the main problem was that some concert halls were too small , and because of that , I could n't see one of the concerts in the program .
I got their address , so we can visit them one day .
Technology is in every part of our lives .
Even if my parents do n't look after me for all the matters like going out at night or studying , you do n't have to think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I ca n't play the guitar , listen to music at a loud volume , or invite my friends for a Saturday night party .
I was one of the few of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert that took place in my town .
We would be terribly grateful if you accepted our offer .
However , the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London , where the latest fashions will be shown .
NOBODY TOLD US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES , AND WE WANT YOU TO GIVE US OUR MONEY BACK , A REFUND .
Please give this your careful consideration .
Apart from this , the computer 's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at any moment that I want to ; five years ago , when I did not have a computer , I had to write letters , which was a slower way to stay in contact with people .
I just imagined what it was like to be a singer .
This is a very interesting question for us and maybe very important too .
It was a kind of map that showed the place where robbers hid a lot of money .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend that you visit the historical museum !!!
Everyone was so jealous at school .
But you ca n't imagine who the singer was . It was Sting , can you imagine ?
Secondly , technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do many more things than before .
All of us must notice this fact .
About the information you need , I must tell you I will only be able to travel in July because I got a new job , and I ca n't ask for more than one month 's vacation each year . And in the other months , I will be very busy because my workmates will take vacations in those months .
And also it is very interesting to talk with writers .
Both of them are convenient for getting there .
I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won , and I am writing to you with all the details you need .
Finally , I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after the show , but it was closed for refurbishments .
I arrived in Ireland on July 2nd .
I saw the musical show in your advertisement during my vacation .
However , it also can make our lives very lazy .
I am writing to complain about the musical , " Over the Rainbow . "
In the end , he wins , but before he is able to get back he has to sacrifice " his fish to attacking sharks .
It was like a dream .
I really think it sounds so interesting .
I would like to know only in July because I have set my vacation this month since last January .
It is going to be very lovely and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises for the students .
Unfortunately , it was used to kill a lot of people .
They were replaced by less famous actors .
This year , I started a private school in Dijon .
It is a famous exhibition , where the latest fashions of leisure and sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles debut .
I feel free as an eagle .
I 've got other questions : what kinds of clothes do I need to bring ?
As if that were not enough , after the show , my boyfriend wanted to take me to dinner at the theater 's restaurant , but the unpleasant surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on vacation .
At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant , so people must have nice clothes ; jeans are not allowed .
In the end , I was happy that I had done this job .
At home , young people should help their parents do some housework .
Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect altrui in his privacy .
You will understand how upsetting all this was , and I decided to visit your restaurant , thinking that could save my visit to the theater ; but it was closed and I had to go back to my hotel feeling mad and hungry .
What I really want to write about is my recent experience .
The party will finish quite late so we 've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely .
So , men have invented machines to help them with their tasks , but nowadays , we are becoming slaves to them .
I have a date with one of them next weekend , but I wo n't tell you the name because you 'll feel jealous !
First , I would like to go travel in July , because before then I do n't have time to travel .
Neighbors have complained about loud music .
Some people think that going shopping can keep depression away .
Speaking of my work , I had to mostly build the concert stage with some people .
People had completely different lifestyles .
Another thing I have a complaint about is the theater 's scheduling .
Another sport I love is basketball .
Besides all this , the theater restaurant was closed , because the chef and the waiters were on vacation .
I think you never realize this until you 're not a part of the crowd .
We could listen for free !
It would be a great opportunity because for students , it 's free .
They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party .
I am writing from Paris where I live .
I look forward to hearing from you soon , and if you could send me a brochure of this vacation , I would be grateful .
I still feel like it has only been a dream !
I had never imagined having to face this situation .
There are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television , radio , fax machines , and microwaves .
Fashion is one of the most popular topics people have discussed in the past , discuss in the present , and will also discuss in the future .
It was the very last day of my trip , and at that time I was in Kyoto .
I can really recommend this book to you . It is fabulous .
Clothes used to be made of cotton , but nowadays we see shirts , pants , socks , etc. , made of almost everything .
At the end of the conference , there is a party , a perfect opportunity for your students to meet new friends from all over the world and chat about their experience .
First , I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing , as your advertisement stated , but there was a different actor instead of him that evening .
I am waiting for your reply .
I 'm writing in order to complain about your current musical show , which I saw last week .
You can take the No. 41 bus from the hotel to the conference . It only takes ten minutes , approximately .
As you know , I finished school two years ago .
I would like to travel in July , because it is the only month that I will be able to take days off .
I would like to ask you what type of clothes I should bring .
I mean , all those flashing lights with changing colors , I believe they helped a lot .
In the winter you 'll freeze .
It could be an advantage !
They will bounce on roads with their balloon clothes .
I 'd like to travel only in July , because for the rest of the year , I 'm working at a bank .
Yes , it is the TV .
How is your sister , Marine ?
On the other hand , I would like to request all details about the accommodations and if you could specify what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I should bring .
I also recommend window shopping .
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
The conference will be held in The Royal Hall , and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus .
We will pay Curly 's doctor with the money we earn , " Pat said .
Another thing was that the show I went to was supposed to start at 7 : 30 , but it started at 8 : 15 !
I am allowed to take vacations only in July .
Please , bring me with you , into your reality ! " " "
If I use e-mail , it 's much easier and cheaper , and I can send e-mail anytime .
I wish all the best for you !
I prefer that kind of accommodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but I ca n't have that in a tent .
Because of this situation , I will be very busy the first week of July , and I would appreciate it if you could give me the option to start my " Camp California " on July 10th .
" He is so bad .
In fact , there would be only one possibility , which is July , because I will end with my exams session at the end of this month , and begin a practical training the 1st of August .
Therefore , I would like to have my money back .
Unfortunately , your advertisement about it was n't true !
If you chose the job , you would be exhausted thoroughly by the end of the concert .
Can you believe that I was helping in the last Britney Spears concert ?
Anyway , I think that 's it for now .
Finally , in my opinion , it would be interesting to film a sports course so that our parents can see that we also improve our body 's abilities , not only our brain 's abilities , at school .
Thank you very much for this opportunity .
Could I suggest that you consider changing the program ?
Anything as a souvenir would be quite enough for me .
I have to add that the weekend ticket was ideal for selling out all the events .
Consequently , I hope that it 's possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July , when the company I work with suspends its activities .
But we have to accept that everyone has privacy . For example , when we get married or when police stop us on the highway , we would n't want just any stranger to notice that .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
I really do n't know why she behaved so badly during her interview .
I would prefer to live in the tent than in the cabin ; I think it is more comfortable .
It closed at 11 pm .
Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices is very enjoyable for me .
This is mostly because I have a job and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months .
But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time .
I want you to know about the extraordinary moments I had with my friends at the festival .
In the end , I would like to say that my evening out two days ago was not perfect , and I would be happy if you could refund some of my money .
I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE GOOD .
Your freezer tells you when you need to buy milk , eggs , or cheese .
I really got to know them after the concert .
From the list of all activities , I have chosen photography and golf .
Furthermore , sometimes you can not find a variety of goods , and you eventually buy a low-quality product .
There are links between the greenhouse effect , technology , and me .
In the advertisement for the show , you said that one of the stars was going to be Danny Brook , but to my surprise it was a different actor , and that really disappointed me .
Today I can connect to the internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine .
During the afternoon , Tim and I spent the hours before the concert playing at the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held .
We saw an advertisement about the Fashion and Leisure Show .
However , I have some proposals about its improvement next year .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
We bought the tickets and then we sat down to rest .
Can you imagine you can be in contact with anyone who is from any country , whenever you want ?
Pat went to Anna 's and she seemed really unhappy .
Therefore , people are used to shopping weekly or monthly .
So , I am going to choose golf and tennis .
Fortunately , it is not far from our college .
Believe it or not , I did makeup for one famous singer .
They are filled with people who want to buy everything .
There is a storm and they can not leave .
On the other hand , and in conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable , living surrounded by lots of gadgets with different functions .
He kept forgetting his lines .
Fist of all , it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is the hottest month of the year , and the weather will be very nice .
It was our family 's secret .
I learned from your letter that I 've won the first prize .
We had been trapped in the snowy , almost vertical slopes of the Tête Blanche for more than ten hours by then .
It seems ages since I wrote to you .
During my time in California , I would love to do some leisure activities , such as swimming , which is my favorite sport .
For this prize , I can choose two activities , ca n't I ?
First , there was a different actor instead of the famous actor , Danny Brook .
In my opinion , staying in log cabins is more fun and much cleaner .
I am not satisfied with your show as it was completely different from advertisements .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
On my third day , I helped them to install the sound system .
Although the show was supposed to be London 's newest and best musical , I am rather disappointed with it .
First of all , the principal character was not Danny Brook , but a substitute , and the theater had not notified the audience about this change .
I could n't imagine being caught .
Secondly , I thought the show would start at 7 : 30 , but it started at 8 : 15 .
We can take care of who we love and give them more attention ; time is not a real problem .
That is why I would like to do that .
Well , it was the best time of my life !
However , the press should n't create rumors and hunt those people like animals .
If you have any time left you should go to High Street , where you could go shopping .
It shows in their attitude to life and in their character .
Students start their day at the gym , where they learn the importance of being fit , which is why I suggest filming this activity .
I went to this festival with four friends , and all of us enjoyed our time very much .
I also would like to get some information about the weather .
As I saw from your advertisement in the newspaper , it said , " Starring : Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . "
Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills , making this a trip to remember .
And , the restaurant of the theater was being painted , so I could not go there as you had advertised .
In the future we wo n't buy clothes by size or even color ; our clothes will adapt to our body , the weather , our size , and our needs .
I mean , would £700 be enough for me for one week ?
Thank you very much for your letter of 1/6/00 . I was really amazed with the news that I 'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
You know , he is my favorite singer .
I was very disappointed !
What you expect when you go shopping , generally with a friend or two , is to wander around looking at everything .
Greetings . We await your answer .
Do you know what , Kim ? I 've never thought before that enjoying yourself like this could be weird .
I am really surprised that I have won .
What do you think about that ?
But differences between rich and poor homes will be the same in the future .
Luckily , I could keep my secret for a couple of days , but then it became urgent , and I needed someone to talk to .
I have n't got my mobile phone with me . " I was halfway between school and home .
On behalf of all the students , I thank you very much for hearing my request . I apologize for any inconvenience it could create . I am certain you will think about that particular visit to " the London fashion and leisure show . " On behalf of all the students .
A party would be nice .
First , I would like to mention that , in our daily lives , we always use some technology , for instance , TVs , stereos , microwave ovens , and others . Another point is that with the help of technology we can communicate with anyone in the whole world .
If it is possible , we can interview the last winner .
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
Nonetheless , people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake .
I do look forward to your reply with my money .
The most important thing will be the figure , such as long legs or pear-shaped .
We were allowed to go out if we did n't want to stay in class .
I told you that I had helped at a pop concert last month .
Regarding your International Arts Festival advertisement , I would like to share with you the pleasure I experienced participating in the event , and some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take into consideration .
All I have to do is choose and buy .
Firstly , I have to say that I can travel only in July this year .
The reason I opted for singing is because I feel embarrassed about my voice , so maybe I can improve it .
When I saw the advertisement for the show , it was written that the show will start at half past seven , but it started at a quarter past eight .
Afterwards they talked to me and thanked me for helping them in those exciting moments .
Third , the disappointment made me a bit hungry , but the restaurant was closed without any information as to why .
We think that if you do n't have any problem with it , we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery , so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
As you know , I am a member of a BSB fan club , and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they had in the city where I live .
I think that could make your festival more popular .
Back in the 30 's , different governments invented guns , battleships , and all kinds of weapons for their armies .
That 's why I 'd like to ask if you could give me some money back .
As well as all the treasures , statues , and historical paintings , there are also restaurants and modern galleries .
In spite of our decadence , some cheap souls still have the courage to say that , by shopping , they 're filling their empty spaces .
The bus will be in service at 9 : 30 PM and 11 : 30 PM , and the last one will be at the end of the party .
I was disappointed when I found the actor was n't Danny Brook !
Consequently , I propose to change the program as follows : on Tuesday afternoon , we could go to this show , and go shopping on Wednesday afternoon instead during our free time .
But , while reading realistic stories , I just fall deep into the story , into the writer 's own world .
Hopefully I will meet some other girls in the same sport , so we can all play as a team .
I always dreamed about going to California and now my dreams are coming true .
Do you want to join me ?
The computer is very useful and has affected our very lives in different senses .
It can show how much students are enjoying school .
We were there , alone , my friend with his broken leg and myself .
They are able to give and receive information very quickly .
In this book , Heathcliff , as a child , was n't a bad character . But the situations he lived with the Earnshaw family , who raised him , made him rude , aggressive , and noisy .
The shopping center is just across the street from the hotel , so some people may want to just wait at the hotel and have a cup of coffee .
I hope you will consider my suggestion .
You do not have to waste money at all .
I must sign off , as I want to catch the mail .
That means , for example , while you are sitting in the office , you are able to control your home with the computer .
In my opinion , math , politics , Chinese , English , and painting lessons are the most interesting ones .
So I will be very happy to improve my art at the camp .
I have good singing skills too .
I SUGGEST THAT WE GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING , AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE , WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW .
First of all , I think that famous people deserve to have a private life .
We will be more understanding with others .
I 'm writing this letter to you because during my stay in London , I went to the theater to see a musical , and I had a very disappointing evening .
How is about an accommodation .
As I was taking a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song , I saw a number of famous musicians nearby .
From the beginning of the century to now , modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier .
They are expected to always be beautiful and intelligent .
It was very exciting to see them !
Therefore , I read Agatha Christie 's " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie . "
Believe me , shopping can also be painful .
So staying in a log cabin will probably avoid a lot of problems .
In your previous letter , you asked for information about interesting buildings to visit in my country .
The school works together with branches of known companies such as Marriott hotel , Air France , and Princess Cruises , among others , in order to provide students with highly qualified training .
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the Seven Wonders of the World , I knew I had to see it .
They ca n't communicate with ordinary children or attend ordinary schools .
I would like to travel in July because I am a student and therefore I only have vacation in this part of the year .
The ticket for the show is included .
I 'm writing to you because I want you to give the money back for your " London 's newest and best musical show : ' Over the Rainbow ' , " presented in the Circle Theatre .
When I received your letter with photographs of that flat , it really looked nice .
Another thing was that there was n't any discount available , so we spent a lot of money on such a bad show .
They upgrade the building every year .
I have also been told that they were going to make a music video from that concert , so I tried to do my best .
In addition to that , realistic stories are more attractive . I personally do n't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they can not be true .
I am excited and looking forward to doing the camp there .
I am very delighted to visit the two-week Camp California in the U.S.A .
But I think I will choose basketball and photography , because basketball is the only sport I can play well .
Moreover , students are allowed free admission .
As far as I am concerned , I would prefer an accommodation in a log cabin , but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a tent as well .
I made two albums about birds and flowers ' lives .
I had to wait for 45 minutes without anything to do .
I think it would be nice for the end-of-conference party if you would invite someone to sing , and give the students time to enjoy themselves and dance .
Thank you for asking me about my taste , and being interested in it .
I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved , ill-tempered , and angry with the world for interfering in their lives .
I 'd like to change a rule at home .
I want to say thank you because I was the lucky person who won that competition .
After the show , I decided to have dinner in your theater restaurant ; but I could n't , because it was closed .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
About the accommodation , I would prefer to sleep in a tent , because I never have , and it looks a lot more fun than a log cabin .
" Reading the tabloids " : is n't that what any one of us loves doing ??
This story happened a long time ago .
I hope my recommendations will help you in the choice of a building to visit .
But when I went there , it was closed .
Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
I have taken a photography course , and I enjoy taking photos of animals .
Some say it is math , which is practical and useful , but the majority say math is boring , unless you choose a job such as accounting , which uses all your math knowledge , otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer .
AT 20 : 00 , we stopped by a coffee house to eat . They shouted , " At 20 : 30 , you all have to be back because the bus will leave . "
I am looking forward to staying in contact with you .
I AM WRITING TO YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU .
I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July .
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value , but should be concerned about morality and principles as well .
As a result , journalists should respect their lives and always write real news .
I went to the theater last weekend to see " Over the Rainbow . "
I have something really exciting to share with you .
I am starting an Italian class in August , so it will be impossible for me to leave then .
The show began later , much later than your advertisement states , at about 8 : 15 . The show started 45 minutes late .
By the way , I 'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should prepare and how much much I should bring with me .
They just said , " We do n't give money back . "
Otherwise , if you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood .
It 's a great opportunity because in our fast-developing world , we have to look fashionable , and this kind of show happens quite rarely .
Technology is what makes our lives easy .
I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on April 5th is suitable for you .
But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me , about the two weeks that I won at Camp California .
Thanks a lot for your letter .
Moreover , I practiced a lot of aspects of my specialty . For me , that was really the most important experience .
The technology is essential to our life . We need it every minute , at every second .
Regarding your questions , the following are my answers .
The start time had been changed - the show had just started at 8 : 15 , and there were no discounts available .
So you will enjoy traditional foods , music , dances , and games from all over the world .
According to the advertisement , Danny Brook would be starring , but there was a different actor instead .
A survey has been done , and the issue is which subjects , lessons , and activities the students think are the most enjoyable .
Well , I tried to do so , but the lady at the desk told me that there were quotas available at that price but were already sold out !
Military technology has affected our lives more than what we think , because most of the equipment we use was originally created by those people .
I was excited to get a closer look at so many famous pop stars .
When an important day is coming , it notifies me .
Paul was wondering whether this beast could be offensive , when the creature said these words , " I am glad to meet you , Paul . "
From one side , these people chose to become public people .
I would like to travel in July , because it is the summer and the weather is sunny , and I am totally free during this month .
Also , we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which was advertised in the newspaper " Metro " yesterday .
I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or buying clothes .
It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the break : the smokers in the school yard , the cafeteria lunch line , and the other pupils , who are sitting in front of their tables doing their homework .
I am glad to answer your letter .
It will be awful .
I love swimming and I 've got a scuba diving license .
Technology nowadays is something everyone has on their mind .
Do you have any rules at school that make you upset ?
My family loves him very much and supports us .
And it is admission-free for the students .
Maybe children will not have to go to school ; they will just stay in their rooms and study from a computer , some kind of on-line education .
Secondly , it was supposed to start at 7 : 30 , but it actually started at 8 : 15 , forty-five minutes late !
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future .
We have been talking for hours in our class about the media 's treatment of famous people .
Finally , I appreciate your organization and look forward to hearing from the next International Arts Festival .
All the students in my class are excited about one more thing .
It was no ordinary fish .
You have to read it yourself . And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book !
However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March .
When I stay home I can watch TV or listen to the radio , etc . So modern technology helps me to spend my free time .
As I 've explained , it was not the perfect evening I had expected , and I would like to get a refund because of the reasons I have mentioned before .
After the play , which turned out to be just as bad as I thought , I wanted to relax in the Theater Restaurant , but it was closed and for no reason !
Even if I did work hard on it , I was very surprised I just won first prize .
Almost everything is connected to computers . For example , education , research , and others .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
Moreover , the play did not start at the time it was supposed to .
The reason for choosing these two activities is that they contrast each other : I want one that 's more exciting and that asks for more agility , and another more calm and relaxing , that asks only for my ability to paint .
We would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion , and we hope to hear from you soon .
Sometimes there are real fights about who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician .
About two weeks ago , I went to London for a week-long vacation .
Also , they are staging their first play on the 2nd of July .
New technologies and facilities wo n't improve the relationship between people .
Realistic stories thus develop our imagination and creativity , which are essential in our lives .
It 's one of the most important things for me , to have a chance to forget about my present luxurious life and try doing something different .
Another aspect is that children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention .
To begin with , in your letter you asked me when I would like to travel .
I am certain you will think about that particular visit to " the London fashion and leisure show . " On behalf of all the students .
I want Tennis and Swimming .
MY NAME IS JAMES CAMIREZ AND I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter , which arrived yesterday .
As I did n't expect to be successful , I am very happy about this result .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
Each of us had a different task .
I think that they will have a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages , like having the entire house controlled by a computer so that , for example , we can turn on the lights of the bedroom by just pressing a button , while we are watching the TV , sitting on the sofa .
What do you think about this plan ?
On the last day , I go to your house and then we thought about our conference plan .
I 'd love to hear all your news , why do n't you come and visit me ?
I prefer to live in a tent because it feels very natural .
On the other hand , if you think that you 'll be in the red , you 'd better stay at home .
People backstage , including me , were helping to clean up all the stuff and get ready for the end of the concert .
Mathematics teachers do a great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons .
Finally , I 'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience of my life .
It was not our fault that we went in after 11 pm .
I was really happy to receive a letter about Camp California from you .
We could n't imagine our lives without them .
I realized that it was a different actor playing instead .
There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets , but that was apparently wrong too .
From the beginning it was all a disappointment .
Most of them have at least 20 floors full of flats .
I 'm not quite a young man , and during the past years of my life I have become accustomed to some comfort .
After a while , she pulled herself together and paused for a minute .
But on the other hand , I have never done surfing . I am completely beginner but I am dying to do it .
Fashion of the Future .
At the ticket office , I also asked for a discount , but they told me this was n't possible , even though your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available !
I would also like to know , in advance , the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included .
I would like to ask if you could add more plays and films for next year .
After the show , we went to the theater restaurant , but it was closed .
It made it possible to discover and talk with new people on the internet , but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parents .
I do n't have a clue about all this .
I was thinking , " What should I do ?
When I must buy something , I usually ca n't find it and then the shopping becomes a nightmare .
Finally , I would like to inquire about how much money I should take with me , and also what kinds of clothes would be most suitable to wear .
So I am very grateful to the man who invented it . Unfortunately , I have forgotten his name .
Finally , I would like to ask you which kinds of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp , the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me , and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
The salespeople are too busy and do n't have a moment to help you .
It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight .
I do n't know why , and I 'd like you to tell me the reason .
We spent 2 weeks with the family .
They wanted to be famous , and they knew the price .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping out with last month ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I 'm going to help them again .
Also , I would prefer to go swimming and surfing . I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool , so I am good at swimming .
In my opinion , shopping is just to cover our basic needs .
Every day , like everybody , I watch the TV , see the International news , hear the radio , play games on my computer , or get across to American or Asian people without going out of my house .
I am one of your husband 's students .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
First , I helped with ticket sales .
What is impressive on this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
Finally , could you tell me if I need to bring clothes , towels , and extra money ?
It 's a good chance for you to improve your English .
Clothes are a part of each culture , and one of those things that express our taste and personality .
Making appointments would be difficult and take more time .
Regarding the end-of-conference party , I would suggest dresses for the women , and elegant suits for the men , although it 's not a formal event .
The party will be from three to six in the afternoon , at College Canteen . For the food , we organized a buffet . Could you also help us with the music which he prefers , if he prefers something specific ?
I helped at the pop concert of a newcomer group and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
It was very necessary for me , because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
I would also take an outdoor class , Training .
You were supposed to start the show at 7 : 30 p.m. , but you started it late at 8 : 15 p.m. , without any explanation .
I did n't work on my first day .
Styles mix , and colors and shapes come back from the past ; only the fabrics are different .
A friend of mine quit one week before , and asked me if I would like to go in his place .
Unfortunately , the show was annoying .
Last but not least , I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America .
The line is not the only problem . If you go by car , there is a parking problem ; if you go by bus , there is , again , a line , and you have to carry many bags during your trip and you wo n't always be lucky enough to find a seat .
But I 'm really happy that I had even a small role in helping people enjoy themselves .
I wish you had informed us before .
The other one is television .
As above mentioned , please take care to give me more information , and if you 'd like to know more , please telephone me for further discussion .
We often go out to sing at a karaoke bar .
I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have been paid .
First , what kinds of clothes do I need to take to the camp , clothes for hot or cold weather ?
I was not really satisfied with it .
First , what clothes should I bring ?
I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you are in New York on vacation .
Sometimes it is necessary , and sometimes not , and overall it is not always enjoyable .
I did not get a discount .
I know you have good taste in presents !
It was said that it would start at 7:30pm , but it did not .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held .
I am very interested in having two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there were only six countries represented .
I am looking forward to traveling .
The reason I am writing is that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Besides , the theater restaurant had closed before I left the show .
Technology , are we prepared for those advances ?
However , we have seen an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
A crowded hall is not a good way to enjoy music .
I have sung in the church 's choir for three years , and I have had singing classes at school since first grade .
50 years ago , Korean mothers would have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food .
So , I have some opinions on this , which I would like to write about .
Anyway , we still want to go to the Science Museum and shopping as well , but we think we can go shopping on the last afternoon of our trip .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The festival was very well organized with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows .
Thank you very much for your letter . I was glad to get it , and have heard a lot about you .
I would appreciate it if you could supply some towels , if possible .
I would prefer surfing or climbing , but I have to think about my health .
I was very surprised when I saw that singers are n't as sophisticated and self-confident as they are written about in the newspapers .
What is it that we use every day for many hours , sometimes early in the morning until late in the evening ?
The designer will have a lot of idea for how to make very nice and useful clothes .
In the future , it will be able to help people even more , since it has been increasing its capacity day after day .
To sum up , I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent , reasonably-priced tickets , like this year 's was .
The other bad thing was that by the time the show started , it was already 8 : 15 when the first star entered on the scene , but your advertisement said 7 : 30 !
People use phones in their personal lives as well ; for example , when they want to talk to their family or friends who live far away .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has been considerably changed by rapidly developing modern technology .
I received your letter this morning and I was very surprised .
You can not only listen to her best detective stories , but also learn English automatically .
The only problem is that , on April 4th , I have my graduation .
Modern technology has changed my daily life from physical to mental activity .
But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing , for example , bread . On Friday evenings and on weekdays , all the supermarkets are crowded .
The activities are quite hard to choose really , because there are a lot of choices , which I like .
Finally , I would like to ask you for some further information about the clothes and the money we will need .
Another problem is , I thought discounts were available . However , there were none .
She is very intelligent .
What we all did was make many cups of coffee and help to find their missing socks or any other clothing .
We can love them without disturbing them too .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Instead of going shopping , we could go to the show .
Besides all those improvements and comforts , I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us .
In every country , there are famous people who are in the middle of public attention .
In addition to this , it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us , because for the students it is completely free .
In conclusion , I think that people who are too interested in other people 's lives do not have an interesting life and are unhappy !
First of all , could you let us know if the date of June 16th is all right with his timetable ?
What do you think about visiting the Arts Museum ?
In 1874 , Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city ( a small town near Savannah ) .
I learned painting when I was in school .
In conclusion , I wanted to say thanks for such a special weekend .
Its first application was to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world and we only paid for that one reasonably priced ticket that got us in for the whole weekend .
When I was a child , I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked , but it was nearly impossible to find them .
So when I read other sharks were eating the shark the old man had caught , I got very angry and annoyed .
On the other hand , I would like to notify you that the festival would appeal to more people if a few improvements were made .
This is an experience I 'll never forget .
Besides all of which , at the end of the musical , I went to your Theater Restaurant in order to get some dinner , because I had left home without eating and I was hungry at that time .
It closed at 10 pm , before the show finished at 10 : 30 pm .
First of all , I was really looking forward to the performance of leading actor Danny Brook , but sadly he was n't there , and his role was filled by a different actor , who was rather disappointing .
We lived in a rush , but there was a lot of fun , too .
If I want to buy a nice pair of shoes , I have to go into a city center center , and browse around from shop to shop until I find the shoes I like .
However , I have never tried surfing .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
If the door breaks , we can replace it rapidly and it is not expensive because it is plastic .
Well , I suppose that almost everything in future houses will be automatic and will follow commands .
I always had my own key and unlocked the door by myself .
As for me , the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer .
I am writing to tell you about my experience at last month 's pop concert , where I was helping my friend Nick , who was the bouncer of the place .
Suddenly a murder happens !
I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions !
In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Moreover , once I was in line to pay for the tickets , I found another problem : there were no discounts available .
When I needed some information , I had to go to the library to find it in books or newspapers .
I am looking forward to your reply letter .
Without doubt , the invention of the computer is the most important technological event .
Or , never leaving the office , you are able to heat the water for a hot bath .
I was so disappointed .
I am writing to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival .
BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORST PART , BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES OF PUTTING ON A PLAY IN THE THEATER .
Your advertisement says " discounts available , " but they were not .
I am able to meet my friends quickly on the internet by just clicking the mouse .
Maybe it is right say that in a flat instead of a building .
Last May , I had a week 's vacation in London , and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for " OVER THE RAINBOW " , the MUSICAL SHOW .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
They are famous , but I think they need to be left alone sometimes .
It looked at me and said ,
The director of the college has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice .
They also took me to an after-hours party and they asked me if would like to do this again .
I prefer to stay in log cabins , therefore I 'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog .
I would rather type some coursework up than to hand-write it .
First , I found that there were no discounts as had been announced in the advertisement .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scary .
I let this pass and I bought it anyway , thinking that it was possible that it was only a mistake in your advertisement .
If it is possible , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollen .
Recently I visited an arts festival , organized with your help .
Or can we find some places to get things ?
Then I 'd like to join the activities swimming and singing .
Finally , I helped them , and in return I had a good experience , as well as enjoyed listening to music .
No doubt she would never , ever look at me again .
We have to think about this way .
Where 's the fun in that ?
I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances .
During break time , I did give a lot of directions to people who could n't find the toilet , and information such as where they could get a cup of coffee .
The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer .
If not , you can go on Saturdays , but sadly , there are too many customers . You ca n't walk , or try on clothes , and it 's very hot .
It was really great .
I hope you will enjoy your journey to our city , and I look forward to meeting you at this conference .
The show finished late .
I look forward to seeing you .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
It 's probably because their parents do not have enough time to leave the city and show them nature .
The Barbican Center was built in 1975 . Apart from banks and important offices , there are also the world stock market exchange , an opera theater , shopping arcades , and book and record stores .
I am now writing this letter , with pleasure , to give you further information about myself .
These things provide me nothing but convenience .
I have given much information on the international student conference . The biggest disadvantage is pollution .
So , in fact , people 's homes will become more convenient and comfortable .
Finally , could you tell me how far the nearest town or village is ?
Is it very hot ?
On top of this , we intended to go to the theater restaurant which was closed because of building activities .
Lastly , it could be nice for students who are interested in the arts if you held special events , for instance : a song contest , a writing competition , or dance lessons .
Even though I had other plans , I agreed , because she 's my very good friend .
From any point of view , the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today .
First , I 'll tell you the name of the hotel . It 's the Palace Hotel .
It has been so long since I wrote to you last ...
Anyway , I 'll tell you about a wonderful experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert .
Nowadays , it 's getting obvious that designers sell only details , but significant changes do n't turn up .
This event was not what I would call , " a perfect evening out " , as your advertisement promised .
The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting everyone with BB guns .
The biggest disadvantage is pollution .
In addition to this , the show did not start on time , so I had to wait 45 minutes .
The designer will have a lot of ideas for how to make very nice and useful clothes .
To begin with , the actor you publicized was going to perform , did n't .
I think it was the water .
I really look forward to taking part in Camp California .
The machine used to read this card was so big , you needed to use a room . UNKNOWN our Computer .
The end-of-conference party is designed to give a rough idea about many different cultures .
There we will have the chance to be made up and to try new hairstyles , too .
Because the London Fashion event takes place on Tuesday , I would suggest a change to your plan .
My friend and I immediately said yes .
I understand you want to know when am I available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
At first , I felt really annoyed and disappointed , so I ran to my brother in order to explain to him what I had seen .
She will come to Liverpool next week , and I 'll put her up .
I am writing to complain about a musical I went to see one week ago .
It contains a wide range of activities ; for example : sightseeing , a river trip , visiting the science museum and a gallery , and shopping .
I feel entitled to compensation for this event .
Thank you for organizing the trip to London .
Secondly , could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin , because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than living in tents .
The most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE .
If you do , please tell me .
Pat told him that I was in love with him .
Perhaps , there will be personal computers , which will control everything , every item of furniture , light , temperature .
It was unbelievable , and tiring as well .
Last , but not least important , is the class called " Know-How " which shows students how to cope with unexpected problems even if they are stressed .
I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring .
I am writing to give information on a very interesting building to visit .
I hope I 'll be able to travel in July , due to the fact that my children have summer vacation after July .
I hope we join the next pop concert together as a team and enjoy our time !
So you see my point .
I hope this is n't offending you too much ...
Thank you very much for many interesting places on this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which we are sure will be very exciting .
I know , they are not like us .
In general , the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools .
All the rubbish , dust , dirty dishes , plates , and cups will be washed and cleaned automatically .
" " " You see , I am a mere product of your mind , but I would like to get out of the Heavy Sleep .
The restaurant should have been open when I came out , but it was closed because of the time the show finished .
I am just coming back from a week of vacationing in London , which has , all in all , been really nice .
Let me know if you are going to come , so that I can prepare the bedroom to put you up .
In addition , we are fascinated with their marriages , children , vacations , etc .
The people who were there to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had waited for too long , and I absolutely agree with them .
You can enjoy your time spending all your money buying clothes , jewelry , furniture , etc. , and you can have a great time .
But the positive way new technology has changed my life is in how I communicate .
First of all , I hoped to have some relaxing entertainment with your show but that was not the case .
I await your reply .
I would also like to know some more details about what kinds of clothes I will need to bring with me , and about how much money I will need .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
You should review your advertisements because you give the wrong information .
However , we saw an advertisement , and we are keen on the idea of going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Her boyfriend , Guy Richie , was there too , and he 's a really good person .
I chose 7 : 30 because night shows are better and it would n't finish late , but the show started at 8 : 15 , and we got bored waiting for it to start .
Communications move the world . Famous people use them to improve their work , politicians for their campaigns , and film stars to promote their latest movie .
It does not matter that people started being more concerned about pollution in the world .
A couple of weeks later , my sister called me while I was at work ; completely devastated and weeping scalding tears , she could hardly pronounce a word .
For getting from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St . James College , where the conference will take place .
Anyway , what you wanted to know was what my job has been like .
We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place during our visit to London , on the 14th of March .
And it 's not ending - I hope that for my thirties I 'll go to Mars on vacation ...
At the end of the summer , we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia .
This is a precise letter that I write you now .
There are some things I would like to ask : the type and quantity of clothes I will have to take , whether it is necessary to take extra money , and any additional stuff ( like raincoats ) .
Everything is easy now .
So , we would be grateful if you could give us the opportunity to see the show .
Another important thing is that , despite the number and quality of films , there were , from my point of view , not many plays .
My job was very easy . I had to help Sting with everything . For example , if he wanted water , I had to give to him water ; it was marvelous .
Thank you for your answer .
But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt whether to use it or not . Especially now , when " big-mouth " Pat spread the news to literally everyone .
In this field , you have to everyday afford the development of new technology .
When the play , " Over the Rainbow " finished , I tried to eat something , but the fact was that the theater restaurant was closed because your personnel were cleaning all the mess that an old dog made .
I would like to travel in July because during that period , I will be free from work . My current post finishes at the end of June , and I will start another job at the beginning of August .
First of all , I recommend you go on the 8 a.m. boat .
In my opinion , technology has made human life easy , more fun , and more comfortable .
Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
She 'll probably come with a friend - if you want , you can join us .
Technology allows us to have more time for distractions or for other things we really like to do .
A home made out of plastic with windows made out of plastic , so we can have our home for a long time .
He / she can just press a button or send e-mail to operate what he / she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .
I am writing to express my disappointment about the play , " Over the Rainbow , " which is performing at the Circle Theatre .
It was n't very pleasant .
Then I can prepare clothes that are suitable for that weather .
So , I wanted to know if there will be more films next year .
Every person in the world looks for technology every day to improve the way they live their life .
It was a good and memorable way to remind us to speak correctly .
But , sometimes I ask myself if the " ancient world " , without science , technological discoveries , and industries was more authentic than ours .
Concerning singing activities , I think I 'm quite good as I have been in my school 's choir for 3 years .
I said , " yes " , and I am sure it was the best decision of my life .
I especially like watercolor painting .
I appreciate these stores for a lot of products , cheap prices , and big spaces .
It is also expensive and I ca n't afford to stay there too long .
Here is the information which you asked me for .
Technology has also changed my free time : great games have been invented , like PlayStation , and you can have a really good time playing with your friends .
Actually , they came from only six countries .
And I was really disappointed with the other actor 's performance .
This way we could obtain special positions at NASA University .
One day , while all their friends were there talking , Pat told everyone that Pandora had committed a robbery . All of them were shocked by what they heard .
It is a good start to go sightseeing by bus on Monday morning . We can see all the famous buildings in a few hours .
Personally , I do n't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops , so I buy everything I can using online services .
Finally , it was a very nice day with great experiences .
I think that if we mix lessons with sports activities , the combination will give us complete success .
I 'm sure we will find another solution .
I do n't like to think of my house and my life without all these facilities . In winter , when it gets dark very early , I need to spend my free time at home .
One story is about ten people who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
However , I go far away from my family and other people and have virtual relationships .
We hope you enjoy it .
I helped with setting up the sound equipment , programming the light system on the computer , and tidying up Madonna 's room !
We prepared some special attractions like live dance music , and a hot and cold buffet .
I was very surprised with the results of the competition .
He actually went to Carla and told her everything .
As you can see , most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided .
I 'm very happy and lazy at the same time .
For example , the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor , but he was not .
This can save lives !
Although I wish that my accommodation at Camp California were in tents . I had that experience last summer .
I would like to ask for a refund .
I think it was very clever of me to record that moment , which I will never , ever forget , and that was the thing I liked the most out of that experience .
Based on everything listed above , I would like to get back the £10 that I paid .
Unfortunately , it could be an issue for me because of pollution from cars and factories .
Furthermore , the show started at the wrong time .
During which , everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers from the conference .
It changes every day , and I do not know if we will be able to understand it .
Then , by some strange power , my left foot was moving , and I wanted to stop it , but it was too difficult .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT. 10 MINUTES AFTER I STARTED FOLLOWING HIM , I BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THE PLACE , AND I FELT MORE COMFORTABLE .
After waiting 45 minutes in this uncomfortable seat , the show started , and then the actors appeared , but I found out that the main one was n't Danny Brook , it was an impostor .
We know what you have done , and your dog will be sold . "
However , I must say , it was quite the opposite .
Who among you could imagine life without a telephone ? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
Well , that is all .
The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event .
Last month I helped at a pop concert , it was marvelous .
Fortunately , the people from my class are really great and we all love trips , especially interesting ones .
It is very useful .
To make matters worse , I had expected a discount with the ticket , but when I went to the ticket box , there was no discount available .
By choosing this style of life , they should have realized what their life would look like .
I did n't get involved that much in writing a script because it was very hard , and the director wrote most of it , but the main idea for the background was mine , and I am very proud of it .
Is there only one teacher for each sport , and how many of us are there in each group of activities ?
" Yes , Oh Lord , he did it because we beat his team at football , " Nick said .
I am very good at playing basketball .
First of all , I will be able to travel in July because I have not finished school .
Also , in the advertisement , you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't . It also said that people could visit the theater restaurant after the show , to eat something or to have a drink .
In conclusion , if you go shopping reasonably , have a good time .
There are many sources of light in this world , such as sunlight , moonlight , and candlelight .
Now then , how was this advertising ? It was completely different . I am really disappointed with your musical . I am asking you for money back , because I did n't enjoy your musical .
Modern technology has changed my daily life in many aspects .
I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends .
I go to the swimming pool two times per week , so I am good at this sport .
When I was younger , I remember that when I had to study or work on a school project , I would take a lot of time researching in libraries , looking for old books .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
From my point of view , people 's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is installed in every machine , TV , cooker , and light connected to the owner .
So they can be just ordinary people like us .
When you work in an office , a factory , or a non-profit , you have the same schedule as the stores , so you can only go shopping during your lunch break .
My name is John and I have been to the latest International Arts Festival .
As I told you in my last letter , I worked in Edinburgh two weeks ago , helping at a pop concert .
I went to the " International Arts Festival " on November 21-22 .
I was really excited with the idea of seeing that show .
I am willing to show you the autograph and the photograph .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I 've never been to California , so please let me know about the weather there .
Shopping is great when you have lots of money and time ; you can buy clothes , shoes , make-up , CD s , whatever .
Another disappointing thing was that no one explained why it was delayed to 8 : 15 .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definitely need one , and that holds true for the class on politics also , because you have to study statistics on your computer for social research and some analysis .
Please send me a list of the items I may need there , including the most appropriate clothes for the American weather .
I was terribly disappointed .
Cellular phones can be inconvenient sometimes , but they can be very useful in certain situations : when your car is broken down on the road , when you need to be found anywhere and at any time ( if you are a doctor , a lawyer , or a journalist , for instance ) , and so forth .
To make things even worse , the play did n't start at 7 : 30 , as it was supposed to , but instead it started 45 minutes late , at 8 : 15 , and your famous discounts were n't even available .
I choose singing because I love singing and have been in a choir for 7 years now .
I am writing in response to it .
At the camp I would like to choose two activities , painting and singing . I love painting . I studied art for two years at the university , but now I do n't have much time to paint because I work in a bank , and I have a baby .
I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday , the 14th of March , from 10 : 00 - 7 : 00 .
As well as this , the stories are going to be read in English .
I am writing to provide you with the information you require .
About the activities while at the Camp , I would enjoy swimming , not because I am good at it , but just because I like it , and the other one is photography .
So try to imagine my situation - I had paid a lot of money and I could n't see a good show . I was really disappointed .
There is one thing I would like to ask you . It 's about how much money I will need to go out at night , to spend on food , and those kinds of things .
In my opinion , shopping is like relaxing .
I 'm writing to express my feeling and opinion about the International Arts Festival , which was held a few days ago .
I am writing to complain about the show I saw last Friday at your theater .
Also , you can spend hours trying to decide between some wonderful blue trousers or a beautiful black dress , for example .
It is up to every individual to change their mind and act as a smart shopper .
It starts already in the morning when we wake up by the sound of an alarm clock , then in the bathroom we have running hot water , and also the whole house is warm due to central heating .
Finally , my parents argue about different solutions to my problem all the time , and this is all thanks to Pat .
I am writing to complain about your musical show .
Maybe you spend all your money on a new thing , and a few hours later your best friend invites you to go to a nightclub , but you are short of money .
I think I would prefer climbing and painting .
Therefore , I have to choose painting and photography .
Should I bring my camera , warm clothes , or any pocket money ?
I could be interested in your letter .
The pop group were all young people ( between 23 - 30 years old ) , and all of them were really nice .
During the day I speak with the majority of my colleagues by telephone or e-mail .
I 'm writing to you following our visit to your theater last night .
One day , while all their friends were there talking , Pat told everyone that Pandora had committed a robbery .
Thank you very much for your letter .
But also , here are some notes about improvements for next year 's festival to make it absolutely wonderful .
By the way , I understand I had better trust in no one .
How much money do I need to bring ?
First of all , I would like to say that it started later than it was supposed to . I had to wait for about forty-five minutes .
We have to face it - it has two sides .
I think housewives will also have more help with a robot in the household .
Differences between male and female will not be important for clothes in 100 years ' time .
I had to wait in the street that whole 45 minutes , because the lobby was not large enough .
You asked me about my experiences .
What do you want more ?
Your dance shows are very beautiful ; art exhibitions are something original and exciting .
I am very glad that I have won first prize in your competition , and I can go to the United States .
The restaurant should be open until the show finishes .
If you have more questions about the conference or something else , do not hesitate to ask me .
Although the jazz , rock , and classical music were great , some concerts and halls were too small . Could you consider making them bigger next year ?
For accommodation , I would prefer a tent , as I love nature , and I like going camping a lot .
What is the weather like ?
Lastly , the restaurant which was going to be open was , in fact , closed without a reason !
I 'm writing to you regarding the radio program next Saturday on which " The Old Man and the Sea , " by Ernest Hemingway , will be read .
My daily life should be changed by these innovations !
The concert organizer requested about 15 people from my arts school to help decorate the stage .
I CAN NOT EXPRESS HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PRIZE .
One of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes . Our school is now the best of the country in all ages . We are prest with this , we can show what we do in order to be the best .
But she did ; she asked me out .
People have also seen how different our clothes have become in the last 10 years .
For the activities , I would like to choose the tennis activities , which I am not too bad at , and climbing , which I have never done but might be interesting .
And , of course , the furniture in people 's homes will not change either .
After the show we went immediately to the ticket office to ask for our money back , but they were too strict and closed-minded .
It was a big mistake to tell her a secret , especially an important one .
With the help of some modern technology , our daily life is not so difficult .
It always happens with people , does n't it ?
We imagine that would be the best vacation of our lives .
They started charging down the field towards the fire , and , once in range , everyone threw their balloons as far as they could .
Moreover , there were n't any discounts , and all of the tickets were the same price .
I sometimes want to hear their voice on the telephone .
The season for this is the global warming , which is the salvation of the problem and another reason why this idea is possible .
I helped with ticket sales , security , and the design ...
In addition , the resort has an interesting historical and architectural background , as well as the best facilities and activities that you can find in Mexico .
On the other hand , during my stay at Camp California , I want to go swimming because I practice this activity regularly and I often do competitions ; it is one of my hobbies .
It would be meaningful for me to take part in your camp .
I really look forward to receiving your reply soon .
Another aspect is that people save time if they have a phone .
In my opinion , it should be a rule that the media may approach celebrities almost anywhere except in their private home , to leave them at least one place to feel safe .
To sum up , it is a big school where you have a lot of interesting classes and some optional activities to do in your free time .
First of all , we 're happy we won the first prize in your competition .
I believe there are a lot of tall buildings now in Japan .
Choosing gives me such pleasure because I never have to worry where the money will come from for my wishes .
Lastly , I would like to ask about money and clothes .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July only because I have two months of vacation which are July and August . I choose July because it is the only month that I think I 'm free .
First of all , it is great that the Festival is International .
Do you know Radiohead ?
Moreover , they will be able to create a special climate for each room .
Another point is the time when it started : exactly 45 minutes late .
About the accommodation at Camp California , I would like to stay in a tent .
As you look around , everyone has a car or motorcycle .
I hope you will understand my disappointment and the reasons why I ask for my money back . I am asking for a refund .
But on the other hand , people will still have to program them , as they do nowadays .
I was wondering what kinds of clothes we need , and what about money and meals ? Are they provided ?
Finally , we should film the lunch , which is also a moment for the students to relax ; and for the teachers , we must n't forget to film the teacher room , because if a school is made up of students , it 's also made up of teachers .
The tickets were a little expensive but I was with TEN other people , so when we read " Discounts Available " , we expected that the theater had organized a special discount for a group with a number of people .
The two activities I have chosen are basketball and tennis .
So , what are we going to do ?
If only I could sing beautifully !
However , you changed actors without informing viewers .
In addition , I would like to talk about the success of the weekend ticket among most visitors , due to its economical price and because of its usefulness .
First of all , I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment .
I look forward to hearing from you .
When the band had just started to play , a lot of girls started to jump the musicians , getting very close to them . Some of the girls started to take their clothes off , which was the best part for me , but some security guards went there and took them away .
It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy . Stores have plenty of every kind of thing .
Secondly , there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small .
We have seen your program , and we like all of it , especially the Science Museum ; it will be a great way to increase our knowledge , and so on .
In the future , they are both getting closer and closer .
Last , I have no experience abroad . Therefore , I 'd like to know about the weather in California in July .
To conclude , in this short video , we must show that , thanks to our school , we are able to make the best of ourselves .

It is a very good program , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class will enjoy .
I am very happy to know I won the prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A .

As you know , I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents ' house , but that Sunday , as I was driving , I suddenly saw an excellent car on the shoulder . It was a Jaguar with Will Smith in it , so I stopped and asked if he needed some help , and he said , " Of course " .

To sum up , the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group .
So you can see that it was not the perfect evening I had planned .
It is my favourite group .
I received your letter last Monday .
However , it was closed for cleaning .
Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money . We usually spend much more money than we expected to .

This is important for everybody , and I think it is important for them , too .
They said that it was n't necessary , so we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenery was being prepared for the concert .
Thank you for choosing our ticket in the final round .
