It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I 'm looking fordward to hearing from you .
First of all you said that the starring would be Danny Brook but there was not .
I think it 's a great opportunity because , we will have a chance to se the latest fashion , leisure and sport wear , and as well the way to do the perfect make up and hairstyl .
But to solve this problem , we may think first about its origin ...
The Computer was invented 30 year or mor ago and estart lake a procesing information with a big cad was perfored and maked a smol hold and aeche hold mean something lake a Codig .
First point we will use more often new technologies like telecommunication or internet .
If people want to enjoy shopping , we must consider before buy something - do I really want it ?
As a teenager I must addmit that there is nothing more enjoyable from shopping .
I think if you have lots of money and do n't know what to do with it , do not go shopping give the money to charity , that is better than shopping .
You can chose the price more suitable for you .
As Modern technology is changing the world rapidly I think we are all involved in the revolution it 's causing .
And also the ticket discounts were not available .
I hope you will find my letter of interest and I look forward to seeing you .
That was not your advertisement had shown .
Food and beverages will be available .
I hope that my advice will help you .
Thank you for your attention .
After working 30 minute , a singer appeared .
Firstly , despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring , another actor was starring in the actual show and his performance was literally horrible , and disappointing .
Another point is that with the help of the technology we can communicate with the whole world .
We 're always want to know about others ' life especially the famous one even the one that we hate .
Now , I have two questions about camping .
The best thing was I spoke in English because I was forgetting it and I met my favourite singer .
Well , I would be only available in July , because at that time I would be in winter holidays .
I am looking forward to the meeting with you and mutual work during conference .
Someone can get to the city centre with the No.456 bus and then on foot to the castle .
One night , I heard a strange sound .
It all comes from my parents .
But this problem is solving by itselfes .
Thank you for everything .
Next morning as Pat was going to school met Bad Jon . and told him " Hey , you .
The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous .
We thought that we could change the programme this way : we could go to the Science Museum Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
You certainly saw that plays and films had a lot of success .
So she asked me to fill her position .
Shopping is when human goes to the shop and buy what they went , however I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes all sort of things .
In the past , everything was very different .
I have just two questions .
The aim of this report is to give some information about The new Acapulco resart buildings which was build 10 years ago and it is one of the first buildings that was build with the latest tecnonology and made by a important Mexican arquitector .
I am looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible .
You also asked me about two activities .
I also wanted to know if I have to take some money to buy souvenirs and food or that will be paid for me , too ?
Endly , I have questions about clothes and money .
I 'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize .
Thank you very much .
Secondly , if you happen to forget something , you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers , and that can take up even more time .
Some time before I did not know the internet .
How has modern technology changed our daily life ?
That is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice .
Indeed , instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ; we had mean actors .
Of course , it everyone pays less attention or interest , the situations should be better .
It was absolutely fantastic prize .
I am representative of our class in your college to write to you .
The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines , so , today 's children must be introduced to computers since an early age , so that they could have a chance to compete with the furious emearrence in the future .
When I saw your advertisement on yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you have written on your advertisement .
In addition , it would be nice if you could send me an address which I am going to stay , so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family .
The entrance for student is free .
I also would like to talk about your concerts .
I ca n't go to the towncentre of big city .
Finaly , I must choose traveling there in July because I am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work .
I 'm really happy to hear from you !
Actually I 've just done light and sound in drama 's day in my school at the end of last term .
Yesterday as I was arriving home I saw him in your yard Mack , he looked very satisfied , Curly was laying on the grass and ... "
I also choose climbing .
Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed .
I will be expecting to hear from you .
His act was not good and he did n't seem like acting Even my son could act better .
Now my dream will come true .
I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre " Over The Rainbow " .
All in fashion pass away in a couple of months and has to be created again .
Write to me soon and tell me if you want to join us for 2001 .
LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUE WITH MY MOTHER .
I 've always enjoyed the hazard and this time getting the password was , indeed , a tough coockie .
I am apologise For any incovenience . and I am waiting for your reply .
I was just walking down by dressing room manager said that if I could help them .
The performances were great , but some halls were too small to accomodate so many people there were that day .
At first , I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor , but she must have been changed since the actor was different .
It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming .
Is it very expensive area ?
I am pleasant to have the opportunity to practice sports as well .
In my opinion in the future people will wear clothes made of a natural fabrics ; silk , cotton , leather , wool .
I would like to travel in June as I have already arranged for a part time job later this summer .
Firstly , the actors were n't those announced .
which I could bring them to be match the weather .
What I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebreties .
I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time .
Now I am happy to give you all the information you need .
Also , I prefer sleeping in a tent than in a long cabin because it is easier to clean .
We think and speak about it in our families .
My name is Paula and I 'm one of your latest visitors of your show " Over the Rainbow '' , this is also the reason of my letter .
There are many historical buildings remain .
Can you guess whe they chossed for the work , " me " , yes me , I could n't belived it .
Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was , I consider myself being very successful .
All of a sudden , a weird creature popped into his dream .
Tecnology change our daily life , it makes our life easily to live and of courese more confortable like with computers , televitions , radios etcetera and some times more secure like in medicine .
I was very happy because on this time I had a chance talking to them and to know more about them .
Everybody are free to dress for the party but be considering to be appropriate .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Amazingly , doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time : shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains .
To be honest , next great invention of people , computer , ca n't work , if you have n't got the phone .
At work we have the most important thing in the world of technology , the computer . Without that we ca n't do anything today .
According to the advertisement I have seen , it is supposed to show the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If I found somenthing special to visit in three hours I call you .
I like to face people whom even I do n't know .
I would like to try it this time .
The first week was find , but on the second week I got very seek .
It was very sorry news to Richard Brown .
During my holidays in London I went to see your musical show .
I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the informations that you have asked me .
Secondly , I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kind of music , but in this case the main problem was that some concerts hall were too small , and because of it I could n't see one of the concerts in programme .
I got their address so we can visit them one day .
Technology is in every part of our life .
Even if my parents do n't look after me for all the matters like going out on nights or studying you do n't have to think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I ca n't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends for a Saturday night party .
I was few of the lukiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop concert which took place in my town .
We would be terribly grateful , if you accept our offer .
However , the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London where the latest fashions will be shown .
NOBODY TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES , AND WE WANT THAT YOU GIVE US BACK THE MONEY .
Please give this your careful consideration ..
Apart from this , computer 's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to , while five years ago when I did not have a computer , I had to write letters which was a slower way to contact with people .
I just imagined what it was like to be a singer .
This is very interesting question for us and maybe very important too .
It was a kind of map that showed the place for a lot of money which robbers hid .
If you really want to discover what greek history means , we strongly recommend you to visit the hystorical museum !!!
Everyone was so jealous in the school .
But you ca n't imagine who was the singer , it was Sting , can you imagine ?
Secondly , technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do much more things than before .
All of us must notice this fact .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month holidays each year and on the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays on these months .
And also it is very interesting to talk with writers .
Both of them are as convinience as getting there .
I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won and I am writing to you in order to give you all the details you need .
Finally , I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after show , but it was closed because it was refurbishing interior .
I arrived at Ireland on 2th July .
I saw the musical show in your advertisment in my holiday .
However it also can make our life very lazy .
I am writting in order to complain about the musical show " Over the rainbow " .
In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to " sacrifice " his fish to attacking sharks .
It was like a dream .
I really think it sounds so interesting .
I would like to know only in July because I have set my holidays this month since last January .
It is going to be very lovely and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises for students .
Unfortunately , it was used to kill a lot of people .
They were replaced by less famous actors .
This year , I started a private school in Dijon .
It is a famous exhibition , where are showed latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
I feel free as a eagle .
I 've got other questions : wich type of clothes do I have to bring ?
If it does not seem enough , after the show by boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theatre 's restaurant but the umpleasent surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday .
At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes ; jean 's is not allowed .
In the end I was happy that I had done this job .
At home young people should help their parents do some houseworks .
Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect altrui in his privacy .
You will understand how upseting all this was , and I decided to visit your restaurant , thinking that could save my visit to the theatre , but it was closed and I had to go back to my hotel felling mad an hungry .
What I really want to say is about my recent experience .
The party will finish quite late so we 've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely .
So , men have invented machines to help him on his tasks , but nowadays , we our becoming slaves of them .
The next weekend I have an appointment with one them , but I do n't tell you the name because you 'll fell jalous !
At first , I would like to go travel on July , because before them I do n't have time to travel .
Neighbours have complained about loud music .
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression .
Talking of my work , I had to mostly make the concert stage with some fellows .
People had completely different life-styles .
Other thing I have to complement is about the time of the theatre .
Another sport I love is basket ball .
Among all these the theatre restaurant was closed , because the shef and the waiters where on holiday .
I think you never realize this , until you 're not a part of the crowd .
We could listen for free !
It would be a great opportunity because for students it 's free .
They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party .
I am writing from Paris where I live .
I look forward to earing from you soon and if you could send me a brochure of this holiday I would be grateful .
I still believe it has only been a dream !
I have never imagined I had to face this situation .
There are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television , radio , fax machines , and microwaves .
Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss about in the past , now and also in the future .
It was the very last day of my trip and at that time I was in Kyoto .
I can really recommend you this book , it is fabulous .
Clothes that used to be made of coton , but nowadays we can see shirts , pants socks .... made of almost everything .
At the end of conference there is a party a perfect opportunity for your students meet new friends from all part of word and they could speak about their experience .
Firstly , I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing as your advertisement already said , but there was a different actor instead of him at that evening .
I am waiting for your reply .
I 'm writing in order to complain about your current musical show which I saw last week .
You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference , it only takes ten minutes approximately .
As you know , I finished school two years ago .
I would like to travel in July , because it is the only month that I will be able to take off days .
I would like to ask you what type of clothes should I bring ?
I mean , all that flashing lights , the changing colours of them , I believe they helped much .
In the winter you 'll freeze .
It could be an advantage !
They will bounced on roads with there balloon clothes .
The second reason is the weather .
Yes it is the TV .
How is your sister , Marine ?
On the other hand I would like to request all details of accommodation and if you could specifie what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to take .
I also recommend a window shopping .
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
The conference will be hold in The Royal Hall , and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus .
We will pay Curly 's doctor with these money that we will earn " Pat said .
Another thing was that the show I went to was starting at 19 : 30 but it started at 20 : 15 !
I am allowed to take holiday only in July .
Please , bring me with you , in your reality ! "
If I use e-mail much easier and cheaper . And I can send e-mail anytime .
I hope all the best for you !
I prefer that kind of accomodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but I ca n't have it in tent .
Because this situation I be very busy on the first week of july , and I apreciate if you can give me the choice to start my " Camp California " from July 10th .
" He is so bad .
In fact their would be only one possibility in July because I will end with my exams session at the end of this month and beginn a practical trainning the 1rst of August .
Therefore , I would like to have my money back .
Unfortunately your advertisement about it was n't true !
If you choose the post , you would be exhausted throughlly in the end of the concert .
Can you believe that I was helping in the last Britney Spears 's Concert ?
Anyway it think that 's it for now .
At the end , to my opinion , It would be interesting to film a course of sport in order that our parents realise that we improve our body 's abilities , and not only our brain 's abilities at school .
Thank you very much for this occasion I 'd like to travel only in July , because , in the rest of the year , I 'm working in a bank .
Could I suggest that you consider changing the programme ?
Anything as a souveniere would be quite enough for me .
I have to add that the weekend ticket was a ideal idea to sell all the events .
Consequently I hope that is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July , when the company I work with suspends its activities .
But we have to accept that everyone has their private life for example when we get married or when policeman stop us on the highway , we do n't want any stranger notice that what is happening to us .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
I really do n't know why she behave herself so badly during her interview .
I would prefer to live in the tent cabin , I think it is more comfortable .
It closed at 11 pm .
Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me .
This is mostly because I have a job and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months .
But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time .
I want you to know how extraordinary moments I passed with my friends in the festival .
At the end I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect and I wold be glad if you could pay my some money back .
I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE GOOD .
Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk , eggs or chees .
I realy got to know them after the concert .
From the list of all activities I have choosen photography and golf .
Furthermore , sometimes you can not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low quality product .
There are links between the greenhouse , technology and me .
In the advertisment for the show you said that one of the starring was going to be Danny Brook , and to my surprise it was a different actor , and it realy disapoint me .
Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine .
During the afternoon , Tim and me spent the hours before the concer laying on the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held .
We saw an advertisement about Fashion And Leisure Show .
However , I have some proposals about its improving next year .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
We bought the tickets and then we sit down to rest .
Can you think you contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want ?
Pat went to Anna 's and she seemed really unhappy .
Therefore , people used to shopping weekly or monthly .
So , I am going to choose Golf and Tennis .
Fortunately , it is not far from our college .
Believe it or not I put make up on one famous singer 's face .
They are filled by people who went buy everything .
There is a storm and they can not leave .
On the other hand and as a conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living sourrended by lots of gadgets with differents functions .
He kept forgetting his lines .
Fist of all , it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is hotest mounth in the year , and the weather shall be really nice .
It was our family 's secret .
I learnt from you letter that I 've won the first prize .
We had been trapped in the snowy , almost vertical slopes of the " Tête Blanche " for more than ten hours by then .
It seems ages since I wrote to you .
During my time in California , I would love to have the chance of some leisure activities such as swimming . It is my favourite sport .
This prize , I can choose two activities , ca n't you .
Firstly , there was a different actor instead of the famous actor , Danny Brook .
In my opinion staying in log cabins is funnier and much cleaner .
I am not satisfied with your show as it was compeletly different from advertisement .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
On my third day I helped them to install the sound system .
Although the show was supposed to be the London 's newest and best musical show , I am rather disappointed with it .
First of all , the principal character was not Danny Brook , but a substitute , and the theatre had not notified the audience about this changing before .
I would n't have imagined if I had been caught .
Secondly , I suppose the show will start at 19 : 30 , but it started t 20 : 15 .
We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention , time is not a really problem .
That is why I would like to do that .
Well , it was the best time of my life !
However , the press should n't create rumours and hunt those people like animals .
If you have any time left you ought to go to the High Street , where you could go shopping .
And it tells on their attitude to life and on their character .
Students start their day at the Gym , where they learn the importance of being fit , that is way I suggest to film this activity .
I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time very much .
I also would like to get some information about weather .
As I saw from your advertisement in the newspaper , it said ' Starring : Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ' .
Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills , making this a trip to remember .
And the restorant of the theatre was being pait , so I could not go as you said in the advertisment .
In the future we wo n't by clothes by size or even color , our clothes will adapt to our body , the weather , our fit so , our necessities .
I mean would £700 be enough for me for one week ?
Thank you very much for your letter of 1/6/00 I was really amazed with the new that I 'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
You know , he is my favourite singer .
I was very disappointed !
What you expect when you go shopping , generally with a friend or two , is wandering around and looking at everything .
Waiting for your answer , receive our greetings .
Do you know what Kim , I 've never thought before , that enjoying yourself like this , could be weirdly .
I am really surprised that I have won .
What do you think about that ?
But about differences between rich 's and poor 's homes will be the same in the futur .
Luckely I could keep my secret for a couple of days but then , it became urgent and I needed someone to talk to .
I have n't got my mobile phone with me And I was half way between my school and home .
I thank you very much for hearing my request . I apologise for any inconvenience it could make . I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to " the London fashion and leisure show " . On behalf of all the students .
The party it will be nice .
Firstly , I would like to mention is that in our daily life we always use some technological machines . For instance , TV-set , stereo , microwave oven and others .
If it sould be possible we can make an interview to the last winner .
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
Nonetheless , people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake .
I am looking forward to receive your reply with my money .
The most important things is the fugure , such as long legs or pear-sharped .
We were allowed to go out if we did n't want to stay in class .
I told you that I have helped at a pop concert last month .
With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisment , I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take in consideration .
All I ought to do is buy and choose .
Firstly , I have to say that I can travel only in July this year .
The reason of my option for singing is couse I feel embarrest about my voice , so maybe I could get it better .
When I saw the advertisement of the show it was written that the show will started at a half past seven but started at a quarter past eight .
Afterwards they talk to me and thanking me for helping them in those exciting moments .
Thirdly , the disappointment made me a bit hungry but the restaurant was closed without any sign saying why .
We think that , if you do n't have any problem , we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure show .
As you know , I am a member of a BSB fan club , and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live .
I think it can make your festival more popular .
Back in the 30 's the different governments invented guns , battleships and all kinds of weapons for their armies .
That 's why I 'd like to ask if you could give me some money back .
As well as all the treasures , statue and historical paintings ... There are also restaurent 's and modern gallaries .
In spite of our decadence , some cheap souls still have the courage to say that , by shopping , they 're filling their empty spaces .
The bus will be service at 9.30 PM and 11.30 PM then at the end of the party will be the last one .
I was disappointed when I found the actor was n't Danny Brook !
Consequently , I proposed to change the programme as follows ; on Tuesday afternoon , instead of shopping , we could go to this show and we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon , during our free time .
But , while reading realistic stories , I just fall deep into the story , into the writer 's own world .
Hopefull I will meet some other girls in the same sport . So we all play as a team .
I always dreamed about going to the California and now my dreams are coming truth .
Do you want join me ?
The computer is very useful and It has affect our own lifes , in differents meanings .
It can show how much students are enjoying their life in our school .
We were there , alone , my friend with his broken leg and myself .
They are able to give and receive informations very quickly .
In this book , Heathcliff as a child had n't a bad character but the situations lived with the family Earnshaw , where the grown up , made him rude , agresive and noisy .
The shopping centre is just right opposite of the hotel , however , some people may want to just wait at the hotel , having a cup of coffee .
I hope you will consider my suggestion .
You do not have to waste money at all .
I must sign off as I want to catch the post .
That means for exampel while you are sitting in the office you are able to controll your home with the computer .
In my opinion , maths , politics , chinese , English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones .
So I will be very happy to improve my art in the camp .
I have good singing skills too .
I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW .
First of all , I think that famous people deserve to have private life .
We will be more comprehensible with others .
I 'm writing this letter to you , because during my stay in London , I went to the theatre to see a musical show , and I had a very disappointing evening .
How is about an accommodation .
As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song , I saw a number of famous musicians nearby .
From the begining of the century to now , modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier .
They are always expected to be beautiful , intelligent , good-looking .
I was very excited when I could see a star !
Therefore I read Agatha Christie 's , , Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " .
Believe me , shopping can also be painful .
So stay in a log cabins will probably evite me a lot of problems .
In your previous letter you asked information about interesting building to visit in my country .
The school works together with known companies of the branch as Mariot hotel , Air France Princess cruise among others in order to provide students with high qualified training .
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders , I knew , I had to see it .
They ca n't communicate with ordinary children and attend ordinary schools .
I would like to travel on july because I am a studant therefore I only have holidays in this part of the year .
The ticket for the show is included .
I 'm writing to you because I want you to give the money back for your " London 's newest and best musical show : Over the rainbow " , presented in the Circle Theatre .
When I received your letter with photographs of that flat , it really looked nice .
An other thing is that there was any discount available so we spend a lot of money in such a bad show .
It upgraded the building every year .
I have also been told that they were going to make a music video from that concert , so I tried as well as I could .
In addition to that , realistic stories are more attractive , I personally do n't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they can not be true .
I am exciting and looking forward to doing camp there .
I am very delighted to visit the two weeks Camp California in the U.S.A. .
But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography , because basketball is the only sport I can play well .
Moreover , students are allowed to admit for free .
As far as I am concerned , I would prefer an accomodation in a log cabin , but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a tend as well .
I made two albums about birds and flowers life .
I had to wait for 45 minutes without nothing doing .
I think that it will be nice about the end-of-conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy theirselves and to dance .
Thank you to ask me my taste and to be preoccupated about it .
I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved , bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering into their lives .
I 'd like to change a rule at home .
I want to say thank you that I was the lucky person who won that competition .
After the show I decide to had dinner in your theatre restaurant , but I could n't because it closed .
The London fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
About the Accomodation I would prefer to sleep on the tents , because I never been in one , and it is a lot more fun than log cabins .
" Reading the gossips " : is n't it what anyone of us love doing ??
This story happened a long time ago .
I hope my recommendations will help you in the choice of a building to visit .
But when I went there , it was closed .
Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
I have taken a Photography course and I enjoy taking photos to animals .
Someone says it is maths , pratical , usefull but the majority says it is boring , unless you 're chose a job which charges all your math 's knowledge as accounting , otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer .
AT 20 : 00 , we stopped in a coffee house to eat . The shouted : " 20 : 30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave . "
I am looking forward to staying in contact with you .
I AM WRITIN TO YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU .
I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July .
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value , but morality and priciples are also being concerned .
As a result , journalists should respect their life and always write real news .
I went to the theatre last weekend to see " Over the rainbow ' .
I have something really exciting to share with you .
I will started an Italian course in August , so it will be impossible for me to leave .
The show has begun later , much more later than your advertisement writes , at about 20 : 15 . The show started 45 minutes later .
By the way , I 'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should prepare and how much much I should bring with myself .
They just said , " we do n't give money back . "
Otherwise If you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood .
It 's a great opportunity because in our fast developing world we have to look fashionable and this kind of show happens quite rare .
Technology is the thing that makes our life easy .
I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on the 5th April is suitable for you .
But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me , about the two weeks at Camp California that I won .
Thanks a lot for your letter .
Moreover I practised a lot of aspect of my speciality , for me was the most important real experience .
The technology is essencial to our life , we need it on each minute , on each second .
Regarding your questions , the following are my answers .
The starring had been changed , the show had started only at 20 : 15 , and there were no discounts available .
So you will enjoy traditional foods , music , dances and games from all over the world .
According to the advertisement , Danny Brook would be starring but it was a different actor .
A survey has been done , and the issue is , wich subjects ( lessons ) and activities the students thinks are the most enjoyables .
Well I tried to do so but the lady at the desk told me that they were quotas available at that price but were already sold out !
The military technology has affected our lives more than what we think because most of the equipments we use were originally created by those people .
I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars .
When the important day is coming , it says to me .
Paul was wandering wether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words " I am glad to meet you , Paul . "
From one side , this people chose to become public people .
I would like to travel on July , because it is the summer and the weather is sunny , moreover I am totally free during this month .
Besides , we would like to go to the London Fashion And Leisure Show , which was advertised in the newspaper " Metro " yesterday .
I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying cloths .
It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the brake . The smokers in the school yard , the buffett and the other pupils , who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework .
Unfortunatelly , I will be able to go only in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for this dates .
It will be very awful .
I love swimming and also I 've got a scubar diving licence .
Technology nowadays is something everybody has on your own mind .
Do you have any rules at school that make you upset ?
My family very love him and support us .
And it has free-entrance for the students .
Maybe children will not have to go to school , they just will stay in their rooms and study from computer , some kind of on-line education .
Secondly , it was supposed to start at 19.30 but actually started at 20.15 . Forty five minutes later !
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future .
We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people .
Finally , I preciate your organisation and look forward to hearing from the next International Arts Festival .
All the students in my class are excited about one more thing .
It was n't usual fish , it was Gold Fish and it asked him as human ; ' Please , let me go and I can do for you anything you want ' .
You have to read it yourself . And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book !
However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March .
When I stay home I can watch or listen to the radio e.t.c . so the modern technology help me to spend my free time .
At is explain it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before .
After the play , which turned out to be just as bad as I thought , I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant , but it was closed , and for no reason !
Even if I worked hard on it , I was very surprised of winning just the first prize .
Almost everything is connected to the computers . For example , education , researching of the Universe and others .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
Moreover , the play did not start at the time it was supposed to .
The reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast itselves , I want one more exciting and that asks for more agility and another more calm and relaxing , that asks only for my ability to paint .
We would be grateful , if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hearing from you soon .
It is sometimes a real fight who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician .
About two weeks ago , I went to London for a week holiday .
Also they are showing their first play on the 2nd of July .
New technologies and facilities wo n't improve the relationship between people .
Realistic stories thus , develop our imagination and creativity , which are essential in our lives .
It 's one of the most important things for me , to have a chance to forget about all my present , luxurious life and try doing something different .
Another aspect is that children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention .
To begin with , in your letter you asked me when I would like to travell .
I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to " the London fashion and leisure show " . On behalf of all the students .
I want playing tennis and swimming .
MY NAME JAMES CAMIREZ AND I'AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLEINTS FOR THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday .
As I did n't expect to be successful , I am very happy about this result .
" What will clothes be like 100 years from now ? "
Each of us had a different task .
I think that it will has a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that , for example , we can turn on the lights of the bedroom just pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa .
What do you think about this plan ?
On the last day I go to your house and then we think about our 's conference plane .
Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .
I prefer to live in tents because I feel very natural .
On the other hand , if you think that you 'll be on the red , I 'd better stay at home .
People at the backstage including me were helping to clean up all the stuff and ready for the end of the concert .
Mathematics teachers do great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons .
Finally I 'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience in my life .
It was not our fault that we went in after 11 pm .
I am really happy to receive letter about Camp California from you .
We could n't imagine our life without them .
I realised that it was different actor playing instead of Danny brook .
There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets , what appeared to be wrong to .
From the beggining it was all a disappointment .
Most of them are flats which have at lest 20 Floors .
I 'm not quite a young man and during the past years of my life I gothave become accostomed to some more comfort .
After a while , she pulled herself together and paused for a minute .
But in the other hand , I have never done surfing , I am a completely Beginer but I am dieing to do it .
Fashion of the Future .
At the ticket office I also asked for a discount but they told me this was n't possible , instead your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available !
I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included .
I would like to ask , if you could expend the plays and films more for next year ?
After the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it closed .
It made it possible to discover , to talk with new people on the Internet but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parent .
I have n't a clue about it .
I was thinking ' what should I do ? '
When I must buy something , I usually ca n't find it and then the shopping become a nightmare .
Finally , I would like to enquire about how much money I should take with me and also what kind of clothes would be most suitable to wear .
So I am very grateful to man , who invented it , unfornutely , I have forgotten his name .
Finally , I would like to ask you which kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp , the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
The salewomen are too busy and have n't a moment for give you a counsil service .
It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight .
I do n't know why and I 'd like you to tell me , the reason .
We spent 2 weeks with the family .
They wanted to be famous and the had known the price before .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping last month ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I 'm going to help them again .
Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing , because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool so that I am good at swimming .
In my opinion shopping is just to cover our basic needs .
Every day , like everybody , I watch the TV , see the International news , hear the radio , play games on my computer or get across with American or Asia people without going out to my house .
I am one of your husband 's students .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Firstly , I helped selling the tickets .
What is impressive on this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
Finally , could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes , towels and extra money ?
It 's good chance for you to improve your English .
The clothes is part of each culture and one of these things which expresses our taste and personality .
It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment .
Regarding to the end-of-conference party , I would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man , though , it is no formal do .
We have organised to do the party between three to six o'clock in afternoon in College Canteen , about food we organised a buffet , but could you also help us with the music which he prefer , if prefer something especialy .
I helped at a pop concert of a newcomer group and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
I would also take an outdoor lesson " training " .
You had to start the show at 19.30 p.m. but you started too late at 20.15 p.m withour any ecxpenetion to people .
On my first day I did n't work .
Styles mix , colours and shapes come back from the past , only the fabrics are different .
A friend of me gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place .
Unfortunately , the musical show was annoying .
Last before least , I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America .
The queue is not only the problem if you go by car there is parking problem , if you go by bus there is again queue and you have to carry many carry bag carrier bags during the your journey and you wo n't be alway luky to find a seat to seat .
But I 'm really happy , that I had even small role in making people enjoying themselves .
I would you informed us before .
The other one is the television .
As above mentioned , please take care to give me more information , and if you 'd like to know more , please telephone me for further discussion .
We often go out to sing in Karaoke bar .
I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have been paid .
Firstly , what kind of clothes I have to take to the camp , clothes for hot or cold weather ?.
I am not really satisfied about it .
First , what clothes should I bring ?
I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you are in New York on holiday .
Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not and overall it is not always enjoyable .
I did not get discount .
I know you have a good taste in presents !!
It was said that it would start at 19.30 but it was not .
The group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held .
I am very interested in going to two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there are people only from six countries .
I am looking forward to travelling .
The purpose that I am writing due to the fact that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Besides , the theatre restaurant had closed down before I went out of the show .
Tecnology , are we prepeared for those advances ?
However , we have seen an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
A crowded hall is not good to enjoy musics .
I have sung in the church 's choir for three years , and I have had singing classes at school since first grade .
50 years ago , Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food .
So , I have some opinions to this , which I would like to tell .
Anyway , we still want to go to the Science Museum and shopping as well but we think we can go shopping on the last day afternoon of our trip .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The festival was very well organiced with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows .
Thank you very much for your letter , I was glad to get it and know a lot of news about you .
I would be appreciated it if you supply some towers , if possible .
I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think in my helth .
I was very surprised , when I saw that singers are n't so sophisticated and self-confident as they are written in the newspapers .
What is it what we use every day many hours ? Sometime 's early in the morning until late in the evening .
I think if we wear this clothes we will travel to every where easier than we use cars , ships , planes and space ships .
In the future , it will be able to help people even more since it has been increasing its capacity day after day .
To sum up , I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent reasonably-priced ticket like this year 's .
The other bad point was the time when the show started , it was already 20 : 15 when the first star entred on the scene , but your advertisement sayed 19.30 !
The people use the telephone also for their personal life . For example when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology .
I received your letter this morning and I was very suprised it .
You can not only listen to her best detective stories , but also learn English automatically .
The only problem is that on 4th April I have my graduation .
Modern technology has changed my daily life from physical activity to mental activity ( ?? )
But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing , for example bread . On Friedy evening and at on the weekdays each supermarkets are crowded .
The activities are quite hard to choose really , because you have a lot of chose which is I like .
Finaly I would like to ask you for some further informations about the clothes and the money we will need .
Another problem is , I realised that the discounts were available . However , there was n't any discount .
She is very intelligent .
What we all did was making many cups of coffees and help to find their missing socks or any other clothings .
We can love them without disturbing too .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Instead of going shopping , we could go to the show .
Besides all those improvements and confort I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us .
In every country there are the famous people who are in the middle of the public attention .
In addition of this , it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us , because for the students it is completely free .
In conclusion I think that people who are to much interested in other people life have not an interesting life and are unhappy !
First of all could you let us know if the date of June 16th is all right with his timetable program .
What do you think if we will go to visit the Arts Museum ?
In 1874 Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city ( a small town near Savannah ) .
I learned painting when I was school student .
In conclusion , I wanted to say thanks for such an special weekend .
Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with only that reasonable-priced ticket we paid for all the weekend .
When I was a child I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked , but it was nearly impossible to have them .
So when I read other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught , I got very angry and annoyed .
On the other hand , I would like to notice that the festival would be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made .
This is an experience , I 'll never forget .
Besides of all , at the end of the Musical , I went to the your Theatre Restaurant , in order of taking a dinner , because I have leaft home without eating and so I was hungry at that time .
It closed at 10 pm but the show finished at 10.30 pm .
First of all I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook , but sadly he was n't there , he was filled in by a different actor , who was instead rather disappointing .
We lived here in rush , but there was a lot of fun , too .
If I want to buy a nice pair of shoe , I 'll have to go into a city centre and browse around from shops to shops until I find the shoes I like .
However , I have never tried to go surfing .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
The door it is broken , we can replace it rapidly and it is not expensive when it is plastic .
Well , I suppose that almost everything in future house will be automatic and will obey to what people say .
I always had my own key and unlock the door by myself .
As for me , the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer .
I am writting to tell you about my experience in the last month pop concert , where I was helping my friend Nick who was the bouncer of the place .
Suddenly a murderer happens !
I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions !
In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Moreover , once I was going to pay for the tickets , I found another thing : there were no discounts avaible .
When I neaded some informationes I had to go to liblary to find it in books or newspapers .
I am looking forward to your reply letter .
Without doubt , discovering of the computer is the most important technological event .
Or never living the office you are able to heat the wather for a hot bath .
I was so disappointed .
I am writing to you in order to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival .
BUT IT WASN'T THE WORSE , BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES TO PLAY ON THE THEATRE .
Your advertisement says ' discounts available ' but it was not available .
I am able to meet my friends quickly in Internet just clicking the mouse .
Maybe it is right say that in a flat instead of a building .
Last May , I had a week holiday in London , and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW , the MUSICAL SHOW .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
They are famous , but I think they need to be alone sometimes .
It looked at me and said .
The director of the College has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice .
They also took me to a after hour party and they asked me if would like to do this again .
Due to the fact that my children have summer holiday from July . I prefer to stay in log cabins , therefore I 'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog .
I would rather type some coursework up than hand-write it .
Firstly , I found that there were no discounts as it was announced in the advertisement .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scarely .
I let this pass and I bought it anyway , thinking that was posible that it was only a mistake in your advertisement .
If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a log cabins , because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollins .
Recently I visited an arts festival , organized with your help .
or can we find some places to buy it ?
Then I 'd like to join the activities , swimming and Singing .
Finally , I helped them , in return I had good experience as well as enjoyed listening music .
No doubt she would never ever look at me again .
We have to think about this way .
Where 's the fun in that ?
I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances .
During break time I did give a lots of direction to people who ca n't find toilet , and information such as where they could have a cup of coffee .
The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer .
If not , you can go the Saturdays but badly , there are too costumers . You ca n't walk , try clothes , it 's very hot .
I was really great .
I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference .
The show finished late .
I look forward to seeing you .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
Probably , because their parents have n't enough time to go out the city and show them nature .
The Barbican Centre built in 1975 . Apart from Banks and important offices .
I am now writting this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure .
These things provide me all convenience .
I have given much information of the international student conference .
So in fact people 's home became more confienence and comfortabler .
Finally , could you tell me how far is the nearest town or village ?
Is it hot enough ?
On top of this we intend to go to the theatre restaurant which was closed because of building activities .
Lastly , it could be nice to students who are interested in arts , if you help special events , for instance , song contest , writing competition or dance lessons .
Even I had planned something else to do I agreed because she 's my very good friend .
From any point of view , the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today .
First , I tell you the name of the hotel , it 's the Palace Hotel .
It has been so long since I wrote to you for last time ...
Anyway , I 'll tell you about my wonderful experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert .
Nowadays it 's getting obvious that designers sold only details , but significant changes do n't turn up .
This event was not what I call : " a perfect evening out " , as your advertisement promised .
The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting every one wit BB guns .
The biggest disadvantage is pollution .
In addition to this , the show did not start on time , 19 : 30 , so I had to wait for 45 minutes .
The designer will have a lot of idea for how to make very nice and useful clothes .
To begin with , the actor you publised was going to perform , did n't .
I think it was the water .
I am really looking forward to take part at Camp California .
The maching was used for read this cad was too big you use to need a room UNKNOWN our Computer .
The end-of-conference party is designed to give rough ideas about many different cultures .
There we will have the chance to be maked up or to try new hairstyles , too .
Because the London Fashion programme takes place on Tuesday , I would suggest to change your plan .
I immediately say " yes " and also my friend .
I understood you want to know when am I available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed so I run to my brother in order to explain him what I had seen .
She will come to Liverpool next week and I 'll put her up .
I am writing to complain about a musical show I went one week ago .
It contains a wide range of activities for example , sightseeing , river trip , visiting science museum and gallery , shopping .
I feel entitled to compensation for this event .
Thank you for organising the trip to London .
Secondly , could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin , because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents .
the most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU IN A VERY NEAR FUTURE .
If you have please tell me .
Pat told him that I was in love with him .
Perhaps , there will be personal computers , which will control every thing , every item of furiture , light , temperature .
It was unbelievable and tiring as well .
Last but not less important is the class called " know-how " wich shows students how to cope with unspected problems even if they are in stress .
I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring .
I am writing to give an information on a very interesting building to visit .
I hope I 'll be able to travel on July . Due to the fact that my children have summer holiday from July .
Hope we join the next pop concert together as a stuff and enjoy our time !
So you see my point .
I hope this is n't affending you too much ...
Thank you very much for many interesting positions in this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are shure , will be very exciting .
I know , they are not like us .
In general , the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools .
All the rubbish , dust , dirty dishes , plates , caps will be washed and cleaned automaticly .
" You see , I am a mere product of your mind , but I would like to go out of the Heavy Sleep .
The restaurant should had been oppened when I came out , but it was closed because of the hour the show finished .
I am just coming back from a week 's holiday in London , which has been all in all really nice .
Let me know if you are going to come so that I prepare the bedroom to put you up .
In addition we are fascinated in their marriage , children , holidays etc .
The people who were there to watch the show were very ungry and they were shouting because they were waiting for too long , And I absolutely agree with them .
You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have , buying clothes , jewells , furnitures , etc . and you could have a real great time .
But the positive way new technology have changed my life is in way to communicate .
Firstly , I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment with your musical show but it was not the case .
Waiting for you replay .
I would also like to know some more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which will be necessary for me to take .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
You should review the advertisements you do because you give wrong information .
However , we saw an advertisement , and we are keen on the idea of going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Her boyfriend , Guy Richie , was there too , and he 's a really good person .
I prefered to come at 19 : 30 because it is better at night and it would n't finish late , but the theatre started at 20 : 15 and we got bored waiting to start .
Communications move the world and famous people use them to improve their work , politicians for their campain and film stars to make famous their last movie .
No matter that people started worred more about polution in the world .
A couple of weeks later , my sister called me as I was at work ; completely devastated and weaping scalding tears , she could , hardly pronounce a word .
For getting from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St . James College , where the conference will take place .
Anyway , what you wanted to know was what has been my job .
We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place while our visit to London , the 14th of March .
And it 's not ending , I hope that for my thirties I 'll go to Mars on holidays ...
At the end of the summer we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia .
This is a precise letter that I write you now .
There are some things I would like to ask : the tipe ( and quantity ) of Clothes I will have to take , if it is necessary to take some money and any additional stuff ( like raincoates ) .
Everthing is easy now .
So , it would be greatful if you can give us this opportunity to watch the show .
Another important thing is that , despite the number and quality of films , there were , from my point of view , not many plays .
My job was very easy I had to help Sting in everything , for example if he wanted water , I had to give to him water , it was marvellous .
Thank you for your answer .
But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt wether to use it or not . Especially now , when ' big-mouth ' Pat spread the news to litterally everyone .
In this domain , you have to afford everyday the development of new technology .
When the play " over the Rainbow " finished I tried to eat something , but the fact was that the theatre restaurant was closed , because your personal were cleaning all the troubles that a old dog did .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work , my current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
First of all I recommend you to go on the 8 a.m. boat .
In my opinion technology have made human life easily , funier and more comfortable .
Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Probably she 'll come with a friend if you want you can enjoy us .
Technology allows to have more time to distractions or to other things we really like to .
Home made out of plastic also windows made out of plastic therefore we can have our home for a long time .
He / she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he / she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .
I am writing to express my dissapointment about the play " over the rainbow " which is performing at Circle Theatre .
It was n't very pleasant .
Then I can prepare my clothes suitable for that weather .
So , I wanted to know if there will be more films next year .
Every person in the world looks for technology everyday to improve the way they live their own life .
It felt to be a good memory to be remember and remind our sleves to speak in a correct way .
But , sometimes I ask myself if the " ancient world " , without science , technological discoveries and industries was more authentic than the our one .
Concerning Singing activities , I think I 'm quite good as I have been in my school 's choir for 3 years .
I said " yes " and I am sure it was the best decision of my life .
Specially , I like water painting .
I apprieciate this shops for lots of products , cheep prices end big spaces .
It is also expensive and I ca n't afford to stay there too long .
Here are the information which you asked me for .
Also change my free time , they had invented great games like play station , and you can have a really good time with your friend playing .
Actually , they came from only six countries .
And I really disappointed from the different actor 's performance .
This way we could obtain seldom places at NASA university .
All of them were schoked by what they heard . As well as this they started to talk about it everywhere .
It is good start to go on sightseeing by bus on Monday morning , we can se all famous buildings in a few hours .
Personally I do n't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops , so I buy all what I can using " on-line " services .
Finally , it was a very nice day with great experience .
I think that if we mix lessons with sport activities the combination will give us complete success .
I 'm sure we will find another solution .
I do n't like tinking , my house of my life , without all this facilities . In winter when is dark very early , and after , I need to spent my free time in home .
One story is about ten persons who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
However , I go far away from my family and other people and have virtual relationships .
Hope you will enjoy it .
I helped setting up the sound equipment , programming the light system on the computer , tidy up Madonna 's room !
We prepared some special attraction like live dance music and hot or cold buffet .
I was very surprised on the result of the competition .
He actually went to Carla and told her every thing .
As you can see , most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided .
I 'm very happy and lazy at the same time .
For example , the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor , but he was not .
This could save life !
Althoug I wich that my accommodation at Camp California it must be in tents . I get experience in the last summer .
I would ask you to my money back .
I think , it was very cleaver of me to record that moment wich I will never ever forget , and that was the think that I more liked of that experience .
Based on everything listed above , I would like to recieve £10 , which I have paid , back .
Unfortunately , it could have an inconvenient for me because of pollution from cars , factories .
Furthermore , the show started at the wrong time .
During it , everybody will have the opportunity to met and talk to the speakers of the conference .
It change every days and I do not know if we will be able to understand it .
Then , by some ' strange power ' my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it , but it was too difficult .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT. 10 MINUTES AFTER I WAS FOLLOWING HIM , I START KNOWING THE PLACE , AND I WAS FELLING MORE CONFORTABLE .
After waiting a while in this uncomfortable place the show started , I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared , but I find myself that the main one was n't Danny Brook , it was an impostor .
We know what you have done and your dog will be sold " .
However , I must say , it was quite the opposite .
Who of you could imagine life without the telephone ? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
Well , that would be all .
The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event .
Last month I helped at a pop concert , it was marvellous .
Fortunately , the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones .
It is very useful .
To make the matter worse , I had expected the ticket with some discount , but when I went to the ticket box , there was no any discount available .
By chosing this style of life they should realise , how their life would look like .
I did n't get involved that much in writing a script because it was very hard and the director wrote most of it but the main idea of the background of the stage was my , and I am very proud of it .
Is there only one teatcher for each sport , and how many are we in each group of activities ?
" Yes , Oh Lord he did it because we won his team at football " Nick said .
I am very good at playing basketball .
First of all , I will be able to travel in July because I have not finished school .
Also in the advertisment you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't , And also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show , to eat some thing or to have a drink .
In conclusion , if you go shopping reasonably , have a good time .
There are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight , moonlight , candle light .
Now then , how was this advertising , it was completely diffarent , I am really disappointed your musical , I am ask you for money back , because I was n't enjoyed your musical .
Modern technology have change my daily life in many aspects .
I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends .
I go to swimming-pool two time by week , so I am good at this sport .
When I was younger I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching on libraries , looking for old books .
I was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
From my point of view , people 's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine , TV , cooker and the light , connecting to the owner .
So they can be just ordinaly people like us .
When you work in a office , a manufactory , a society , you have the same planning to them . So you just can go to do a shopping during your lunch break .
Mine name is John and I have been in the latest International Arts Festival .
As I told you in my last letter , I worked two weeks ago in Edinburgh helping at a pop concert .
I went to the " International Arts Festival " on 21-22 November .
I was really excited with the idea of seeing that show .
I am willing to show you the authograph and the photograph .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I 've never been to California , therefore please let me know about the weather there .
The shopping is great when you have lots of moneys , times ; you can buy clothes , shoes , make-up ; CD , whatever .
Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed by 20 : 15 .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysys .
Please send me a list of the items I many need there , including the most appropriate clothes for the american weather .
I was terribly disappointed .
Celular phone can be inconvenient sometimes , but it can be very useful in certain situations : when your car is broken on the road , when you need to be found anywhere and at any time ( if you are a doctor , a lawyer or a journalist , for instance ) , and so forth .
To make things even worse , the play did n't start at 19 : 30 as it was supposed to but instead it started 45 minutes late , at 20 : 15 , and there were n't even your famous discounts available .
I choose singing because I love singing and I am in a choir for 7 years now .

There is one thing I would like to ask you . It 's about how much money I will need to go out at night , to spend with food and this kind of thing .
In my opinion , shopping is like relaxing .
I 'm writting to express my feeling and opinion about the International Arts Festival which held a few days ago .
I am writing to complain about the musical show I have seen last Friday in your theatre .
Also , you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue trousers or a beautiful black dress , for example .
It depends on every individual to change your mind and act as a ' smart ' shopper .
It starts already in the morning that we wake up by the sound of an alarm clock , than in the bathroom we have running hot water and also the hole house is warm due to central heating .
Finally , my parents are all the time argueing about differents solutions to my problem , and this all thanks to Pat .
I am writing to complain about your musical show .
Maybe you will spend all your money for a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to night-club but you are short of money .
I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting .
I have to choose painting and the photography therefore .
Should I bring my camera , warm clothes or any pocket money ?
I could be interested in your letter .
The pop group were all young people ( between 23 - 30 years old ) , and all of them were really nice .
During all the day I speak with the majority of my collegues by telephone or e-mail .
I 'm writing you followwing our visitting your theatre last night .
One day while all their friends were there and talking , Pat told everyone that Pandora had done a robbery .
Thank you very much for your letter .
But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year 's festival to make it absolutelly wonderful .
By the way , I 've understood I had better trust in nobody .
How much do I have to bring the money ?
First off all I would like to say that it has started later than it should to , I had to wait for about fourty-five minutes .
We have to face it - it has both sides .
I think also housewifes will receive more help with a robotor in the household .
Between male and female will be not important for clothes in 100 years time .
I had to wait all that time in the street , because the hall was not big enough .
You asked me about my experiences .
What do you want more ?
Your dance shows are very beautiful , art exhibitions is something original and exciting .
I am very glad that I have won first prize in your competition and I can go to the United States .
The restaurant should open until the show finish .
If you have more questions about the conference and something else , do not hesitate to ask me .
Although the jazz , rock and classical music was great , some concerts and halls are too small , could you consider making them bigger next year .
For accommodation I would prefer a tent , as I love nature and I like going camping a lot .
And what is the weather like ?
Lastly , the restaurant which was going to be opened was in fact closed without a reason !
I 'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where " The old man and the Sea " by Earnest Hemingway will be read .

We imagine that would be the best holidays in our life .
they started charging down the field towards the fire and once in range everyone thew their balloon as far as they could .
Moreover there was not any discounts and all of the tickets had the same prizes .
I sometimes want to hear their voice on the telephone .
The season for this is the global warming , which is the salvation of the problem and another reason why this idea is possible .
I helped with the selling of the tickets , with the security , with the designing ...
In addition the resort has an interesting History background about arquitectory and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico for example , it provides differents kinds of tours around Mexico .

It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp .
I really look forward to receiving your reply soon .
Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone .
In my opinion it should be a rule which let the medias approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe .

I hope you will understand my disappointment and the reasons why I ask for my money back .
But , on the other hand , people will still have to programm them , as they have to do nowadays .
I was wondering which kind of clothes we need and what about money and meals , Are they provided ?
Finally we should film the lunch , which is also a moment to relax for the students , and for the teatchers , we must n't forget to film the teatcher room because if a school is made of students , it 's also made of teatchers .
The tickets were a little expensive but I was with other TEN people , so when we read " Discounts Available " we expected that the theatre had organised a special discount for group of numerous people .
The two activities I have chosen are basketball and tennis .
So , what are we going to do ?
