It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
First of all , you said that the starring would be Danny Brook , but there was not .
I think it 's a great opportunity because we will have a chance to sing the latest fashion , leisure , and sportswear , as well as the way to do the perfect makeup and hairstyl .
But to solve this problem , we may think first about its origin .
The computer was invented 30 years or mor ago , and estart lake a procesing information with a big cad was perfored and made a smol hold , and aeche hold mean something lake a Codig .
First , we will use more often new technologies like telecommunication or the Internet .
If people want to enjoy shopping , we must consider before buying something . Do I really want it ?
As a teenager , I must add that there is nothing more enjoyable from shopping .
I think if you have lots of money and do n't know what to do with it , do not go shopping , give the money to charity , that is better than shopping .
You can choose the price more suitable for you .
As modern technology is changing the world rapidly , I think we are all involved in the revolution it 's causing .
Also , the ticket discounts were not available .
I hope you will find my letter of interest , and I look forward to seeing you .
That was not your advertisement .
Food and beverages will be available .
I hope that my advice will help you .
Thank you for your attention .
After working 30 minutes , a singer appeared .
Firstly , despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring , another actor was starring in the actual show , and his performance was literally horrible and disappointing .
Another point is that with the help of technology , we can communicate with the whole world .
We always want to know about others ' lives , especially the famous one , even the one that we hate .
Now , I have two questions about camping :
The best thing was I spoke in English because I was forgetting it , and I met my favourite singer .
Well , I would be only available in July because , at that time , I would be in winter holidays .
I am looking forward to meeting with you and mutual work during the conference .
Someone can get to the city centre with the No. 456 bus and then on foot to the castle .
One night , I heard a strange sound .
It all comes from my parents .
However , this problem is solved by itselfes .
Thank you for everything .
The next morning , Pat was going to school , meeting Bad Jon . and told him , " Hey , you .
The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous .
We thought that we could change the programme this way : we could go to the Science Museum Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
You certainly saw that plays and films had a lot of success .
so she asked me to fill her position .
Shopping is when humans go to the shop and buy what they go ; however , I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes all sort of things .
In the past , everything was very different .
I have just two questions :
The aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resart buildings , which was built 10 years ago , and it is one of the first buildings that was built with the latest technology and made by an important Mexican arquitector .
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
You also asked me about two activities .
I also wanted to know if I have to take some money to buy souvenirs and food or that will be paid for me , too ?
I have questions about clothes and money .
I 'm very happy to know that I won the first prize .
Thank you very much .
Secondly , if you happen to forget something , you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers , and that can take up even more time .
Some time before , I did not know the internet .
How has modern technology changed our daily lives ?
That is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice .
Indeed , instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , we had mean actors .
Of course , if everyone pays less attention or interest , the situations should be better .
It was an absolutely fantastic prize .
I am representative of our class in your college to write to you .
The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines , so today 's children must be introduced to computers since an early age so that they could have a chance to compete with the furious emearrence in the future .
When I saw your advertisement on yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you have written on your advertisement .
In addition , it would be nice if you could send me an address that I am going to stay so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family .
The entrance for students is free .
I would also like to talk about your concerts .
I ca n't go to the towncentre of a big city .
Finally , I must choose traveling there in July because I am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work .
I 'm really happy to hear from you !
Actually , I 've just done light and sound in drama 's day in my school at the end of last term .
Yesterday as I was arriving home , I saw him in your yard Mack . He looked very satisfied . Curly was lying on the grass and ... "
I also choose climbing .
Afterwards , I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant , but it was closed .
I will be expecting to hear from you .
His act was not good , and he did n't seem like acting . Even my son could act better .
Now , my dream will come true .
I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre " Over The Rainbow . "
All in fashion pass away in a couple of months and has to be created again .
Write to me soon and tell me if you want to join us in 2001 .
LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUE WITH MY MOTHER .
I 've always enjoyed the hazard , and this time getting the password was , indeed , a tough coockie .
I apologize for any inconvenience . I am waiting for your reply .
I was just walking down by dressing room manager said that if I could help them ,
The performances were great , but some halls were too small to accommodate so many people there were that day .
At first , I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor , but she must have been changed since the actor was different .
It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming .
Is it a very expensive area ?
I am pleasant to have the opportunity to practice sports , as well .
In my opinion , in the future , people will wear clothes made of natural fabrics : silk , cotton , leather , and wool .
I would like to travel in June as I have already arranged for a part-time job later this summer .
Firstly , the actors were n't those announced .
I could bring them to match the weather .
What I realised was that they were not different from any of us , but they were called celebreties .
I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time .
Now , I am happy to give you all the information you need .
Also , I prefer sleeping in a tent than in a long cabin because it is easier to clean .
We think and speak about it in our families .
My name is Paula , and I 'm one of your latest visitors of your show " Over the Rainbow . '' This is also the reason for my letter .
There are many historical buildings .
Can you guess that they chossed for the work , " Me , " yes me , I could n't believe it .
Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was , I considered myself very successful .
All of a sudden , a weird creature popped into his dream .
Tecnology changes our daily lives ; it makes our lives easier to live and of courese more comfortable , like computers , televitions , radios , etcetera , and some times more secure like in medicine .
I was very happy because , at this time , I had a chance to talk to them and to know more about them .
Everybody is free to dress for the party , but be considered to be appropriate .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Amazingly , doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time : shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains .
To be honest , the next great invention of people , computer , ca n't work if you have n't got the phone .
At work , we have the most important thing in the world of technology , the computer . Without that , we ca n't do anything today .
According to the advertisement I have seen , it is supposed to show the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , makeup , and hairstyles .
I am fine but am quite busy because I have my German exams .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If I found it interesting to visit in three hours , I called you .
I like to face people who even I do n't know .
I would like to try this time .
The first week was found , but on the second week , I got very seek .
It was very sorry news to Richard Brown .
During my holidays in London , I went to see your musical show .
I welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the information that you have asked me .
Secondly , I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kinds of music , but in this case , the main problem was that some concerts hall were too small , and because of it , I could n't see one of the concerts in programme .
I got their address so we can visit them one day .
Technology is in every part of our lives .
Even if my parents do n't look after me for all the matters like going out on nights or studying , you do n't have to think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I ca n't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends for a Saturday night party .
I was a few of the lukiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop concert , which took place in my town .
We would be terribly grateful if you accepted our offer .
However , the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London where the latest fashions will be shown .
NOBODY TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES , AND WE WANT THAT YOU GIVE US BACK THE MONEY .
Please give this your careful consideration .
Apart from this , the computer 's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to , while five years ago , when I did not have a computer , I had to write letters , which was a slower way to contact people .
I just imagined what it was like to be a singer .
This is a very interesting question for us and maybe very important , too .
It was a kind of map that showed the place for a lot of money , which robbers hid .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend you to visit the hystorical museum !
Everyone was so jealous in school .
But you ca n't imagine who was the singer , it was Sting , can you imagine ?
Secondly , technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do much more things than before .
All of us must notice this fact .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because I got a new job , and I ca n't ask for more than one month holidays each year , and on the other months , I will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays on these months .
Also , it is very interesting to talk with writers .
Both of them are as convenient as getting there .
I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won , and I am writing to you in order to give you all the details you need .
Finally , I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after show , but it was closed because it was refurbishing the interior .
I arrived at Ireland on July 23 .
I saw the musical show in your advertisement on my holiday .
However , it also can make our lives very lazy .
I am writing in order to complain about the musical show " Over the rainbow . "
In the end , he wins , but before he is able to get back , he has to " sacrifice " his fish to attacking sharks .
It was like a dream .
I really think it sounds so interesting .
I would like to know only in July because I have set my holidays this month since last January .
It is going to be very lovely and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises for students .
Unfortunately , it was used to kill a lot of people .
They were replaced by less famous actors .
This year , I started a private school in Dijon .
It is a famous exhibition that shows the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , makeup , and hairstyles .
I feel free as an eagle .
I 've got other questions : Which type of clothes do I have to bring ?
If it did not seem enough , after the show by boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theatre 's restaurant , the umpleasent surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday .
At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant , so people must have nice clothes ; jeans are not allowed .
In the end , I was happy that I had done this job .
At home , young people should help their parents do some housework .
Therefore , we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect altruism in his privacy .
You will understand how upseting all this was , and I decided to visit your restaurant , thinking that could save my visit to the theatre , but it was closed , and I had to go back to my hotel , feeling mad and hungry .
What I really want to say is my recent experience .
The party will finish quite late , so we 've decided to provide a bus that would take you to the hotel safely .
So , men have invented machines to help him on his tasks , but nowadays , we are becoming slaves of them .
The next weekend , I have an appointment with one them , but I do n't tell you the name because you 'll fell jalous !
At first , I would like to travel in July because before them , I do n't have time to travel .
Neighbours have complained about loud music .
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression .
Talking of my work , I had to mostly make the concert stage with some fellows .
People had completely different lifestyles .
Another thing I have to complement is the time of the theatre .
Another sport I love is a basket ball .
Among all these , the theatre restaurant was closed because the shef and the waiters were on holiday .
I think you never realize this until you 're not a part of the crowd .
We could listen for free !
It would be a great opportunity because for students , it 's free .
They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party .
I am writing from Paris where I live .
I look forward to hearing from you soon , and if you could send me a brochure of this holiday , I would be grateful .
I still believe it has only been a dream !
I never imagined I had to face this situation .
There are many indispensable electrical appliances , such as television , radio , fax machines , and microwaves .
Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss in the past , now and also in the future .
It was the very last day of my trip , and at that time , I was in Kyoto .
I can really recommend you this book ; it is fabulous .
Clothes that used to be made of coton , but nowadays we can see shirts , pants socks ... made of almost everything .
At the end of the conference , there is a party a perfect opportunity for your students to meet new friends from all parts of the world , and they could speak about their experience .
Firstly , I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing as your advertisement already said , but there was a different actor instead of him at that evening .
I am waiting for your reply .
I 'm writing in order to complain about your current musical show , which I saw last week .
You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference ; it only takes ten minutes .
As you know , I finished school two years ago .
I would like to travel in July because it is the only month that I will be able to take off days .
I would like to ask you what type of clothes I should bring .
I mean , all that flashing lights , the changing colours of them , I believe they helped much .
In the winter , you 'll freeze .
It could be an advantage .
They will bounced on roads with their balloon clothes .
The second reason is the weather .
Yes , it is the TV .
How is your sister , Marine ?
On the other hand , I would like to request all details of accommodation and if you could specify what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to take .
I also recommend a window shopping .
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
The conference will be held in The Royal Hall , and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus .
We will pay Curly 's doctor with the money that we will earn , " Pat said .
Another thing was that the show I went to was starting at 19 : 30 , but it started at 20 : 15 !
I am allowed to take holiday only in July .
Please bring me with you in your reality ! "
If I use e-mail much easier and cheaper , I can send e-mail anytime .
I hope all the best for you !
I prefer that kind of accomodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but I ca n't have it in tent .
Because of this situation , I am very busy on the first week of July , and I appreciate it if you can give me the choice to start my " Camp California " from July 10th .
" He is so bad .
In fact , there would be only one possibility in July because I will end with my exams session at the end of this month and begin a practical training the 1st of August .
Therefore , I would like to have my money back .
Unfortunately , your advertisement about it was n't true !
If you choose the post , you would be exhausted throughout the concert .
Can you believe that I was helping in the last Britney Spears ' Concert ?
Anyway , it thinks that 's it for now .
In the end , to my opinion , it would be interesting to film a course of sport in order that our parents realise that we improve our body 's abilities and not only our brain 's abilities at school .
Thank you very much for this occasion . I 'd like to travel only in July because , in the rest of the year , I 'm working in a bank .
Could I suggest changing the programme ?
Anything , as a souveniere , would be quite enough for me .
I have to add that the weekend ticket was an ideal idea to sell all the events .
Consequently , I hope that it is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July when the company I work with suspends its activities .
But we have to accept that everyone has their private lives ; for example , when we get married or when policemen stop us on the highway , we do n't want any stranger notice that what is happening to us .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
I really do n't know why she behaved herself so badly during her interview .
I would prefer to live in the tent cabin ; I think it is more comfortable .
It closed at 11 p.m .
Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me .
This is mostly because I have a job , and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months .
But now , I am thinking that it was a waste of time .
I want you to know how extraordinary moments I passed with my friends in the festival .
In the end , I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect , and I would be glad if you could pay my some money back .
I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE GOOD .
Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk , eggs , or chees .
I really got to know them after the concert .
From the list of all activities , I have choosen photography and golf .
Furthermore , sometimes you can not find a variety of goods , and you eventually buy a low-quality product .
There are links between the greenhouse , technology , and me .
In the advertisement for the show , you said that one of the starring was going to be Danny Brook , and to my surprise , it was a different actor , and it really disapoints me .
Today , I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine .
During the afternoon , Tim and I spent the hours before the concer laying on the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held .
We saw an advertisement about the Fashion and Leisure Show .
However , I have some proposals about improving next year .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
We bought the tickets , and then we sat down to rest .
Can you think you contact anyone who is from any country whenever you want ?
Pat went to Anna 's , and she seemed really unhappy .
Therefore , people used to shop weekly or monthly .
So , I am going to choose Golf and Tennis .
Fortunately , it is not far from our college .
Believe it or not , I put makeup on one famous singer 's face .
They are filled by people who buy everything .
There is a storm , and they can not leave .
On the other hand , and as a conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living , sourrended by lots of gadgets with different functions .
He kept forgetting his lines .
First of all , it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is hotest mounth in the year , and the weather shall be really nice .
It was our family 's secret .
I learnt from your letter that I won the first prize .
We had been trapped in the snowy , almost vertical slopes of the " Tête Blanche " for more than ten hours by then .
It seems to be ages since I wrote to you .
During my time in California , I would love to have the chance of some leisure activities , such as swimming . It is my favourite sport .
This prize , I can choose two activities , ca n't you ?
Firstly , there was a different actor instead of the famous actor Danny Brook .
In my opinion , staying in log cabins is funnier and much cleaner .
I am not satisfied with your show , as it was definitely different from advertisements .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
On my third day , I helped them to install the sound system .
Although the show was supposed to be London 's newest and best musical show , I am rather disappointed with it .
First of all , the principal character was not Danny Brook but a substitute , and the theatre had not notified the audience about this changing before .
I would n't have imagined if I had been caught .
Secondly , I suppose the show will start at 19 : 30 , but it started at 20 : 15 .
We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention ; time is not a really problem .
That is why I would like to do that .
Well , it was the best time of my life !
However , the press should n't create rumours and hunt those people like animals .
If you have any time left , you ought to go to the High Street , where you could go shopping .
It tells on their attitude to life and on their character .
Students start their day at the gym , where they learn the importance of being fit ; that is the way I suggest to film this activity .
I went to this festival with four friends , and all of us enjoyed our time very much .
I would also like to get some information about the weather .
As I saw from your advertisement in the newspaper , it said , ' Starring : Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ' .
Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills , making this a trip to remember .
And the restorant of the theatre was being pait , so I could not go as you said in the advertisement .
In the future , we wo n't by clothes by size or even color ; our clothes will adapt to our bodies , the weather , our fit , and our necessities .
I mean would £700 be enough for me for one week ?
Thank you very much for your letter of 1/6/00 . I was really amazed with the new that I 'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
You know , he is my favourite singer .
I was very disappointed !
What you expect when you go shopping , generally with a friend or two , is wandering around and looking at everything .
Waiting for your answer and receiving our greetings .
Do you know what Kim , I 've never thought before , that enjoying yourself like this could be weirdly .
I am really surprised that I have won .
What do you think about that ?
However , the differences between rich and poor homes will be the same in the future .
Luckely , I could keep my secret for a couple of days , but then , it became urgent , and I needed someone to talk to .
I have n't got my mobile phone with me , and I was halfway between my school and home .
I thank you very much for hearing my request . I apologise for any inconvenience it could make . I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to " the London fashion and leisure show . " on behalf of all the students .
The party will be nice .
Firstly , I would like to mention that in our daily life , we always use some technological machines . for instance , TV-set , stereo , microwave oven , and others .
If it sould be possible , we can make an interview to the last winner .
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
Nonetheless , people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake .
I am looking forward to receiving your reply with my money .
The most important thing is the fugure , such as long legs or pear-sharped .
We were allowed to go out if we did n't want to stay in class .
I told you that I have helped at a pop concert last month .
With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisement , I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take into consideration .
All I ought to do is buy and choose .
Firstly , I have to say that I can travel only in July this year .
The reason for my option for singing is couse . I feel embarrest about my voice , so maybe I could get it better .
When I saw the advertisement of the show , it was written that the show will start at a half past seven but started at a quarter past eight .
Afterwards , they talked to me and thanked me for helping them in those exciting moments .
Thirdly , the disappointment made me a bit hungry , but the restaurant was closed without any sign saying why .
We think that if you do n't have any problem , we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure show .
As you know , I am a member of a BSB fan club , and last month , we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live .
I think it can make your festival more popular .
Back in the 30s , the different governments invented guns , battleships , and all kinds of weapons for their armies .
That 's why I 'd like to ask if you could give me some money back .
as well as all the treasures , statue , and historical paintings ... There are also restaurants and modern gallaries .
In spite of our decadence , some cheap souls still have the courage to say that , by shopping , they 're filling their empty spaces .
The bus will be service at 9.30 PM , and 11.30 PM , then at the end of the party , will be the last one .
I was disappointed when I found the actor was n't Danny Brook !
Consequently , I proposed to change the programme as follows : on Tuesday afternoon , instead of shopping , we could go to this show , and we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon , during our free time .
But , while reading realistic stories , I just fall deep into the story into the writer 's own world .
Hopefull , I will meet some other girls in the same sport . So , we all play as a team .
I always dreamed about going to California , and now my dreams are coming true .
Do you want to join me ?
The computer is very useful , and it has affected our own lives in different meanings .
It can show how much students enjoy their lives in school .
We were there , alone , my friend , with his broken leg and myself .
They are able to give and receive information very quickly .
In this book , Heathcliff , as a child , had n't a bad character , but the situations lived with the family Earnshaw , where the grown up made him rude , aggressive , and noisy .
The shopping centre is just the opposite of the hotel ; however , some people may want to just wait at the hotel , having a cup of coffee .
I hope you will consider my suggestion .
You do not have to waste money at all .
I must sign off as I want to catch the post .
That means for the exampel while you are sitting in the office , you are able to controll your home with the computer .
In my opinion , maths , politics , Chinese , English , and painting lessons are the most interesting ones .
so I will be very happy to improve my art in the camp .
I have good singing skills , too .
I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW .
First of all , I think that famous people deserve to have a private life .
We will be more comprehensible with others .
I 'm writing this letter to you because during my stay in London , I went to the theatre to see a musical show , and I had a very disappointing evening .
How about an accommodation ?
As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song , I saw a number of famous musicians nearby .
From the beginning of the century to now , modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier .
They are always expected to be beautiful , intelligent , good-looking .
I was very excited when I could see a star !
Therefore , I read Agatha Christie 's , Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie .
Believe me , shopping can also be painful .
So , staying in a log cabins will probably evite me a lot of problems .
In your previous letter , you asked information about interesting buildings to visit in my country .
The school works together with known companies of the branch as Mariot Hotel , Air France Princess cruise , among others in order to provide students with highly qualified training .
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders , I knew I had to see it .
They ca n't communicate with ordinary children and attend ordinary schools .
I would like to travel on just because I am a student ; therefore , I only have holidays in this part of the year .
The ticket for the show is included .
I 'm writing to you because I want you to give the money back for your " London 's newest and best musical show : Over the rainbow , " presented in the Circle Theatre .
When I received your letter with photographs of that flat , it really looked nice .
Another thing is that there was any discount available , so we spent a lot of money in such a bad show .
It upgraded the building every year .
I have also been told that they were going to make a music video from that concert , so I tried as well as I could .
In addition to that , realistic stories are more attractive . I personally do n't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they can not be true .
I am excited and looking forward to doing camp there .
I am delighted to visit the two weeks of Camp California in the U.S.A. .
But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography because basketball is the only sport I can play well .
Moreover , students are allowed to admit for free .
As far as I am concerned , I would prefer an accomodation in a log cabin , but in case there are no cabins left , I can stay in a tend as well .
I made two albums about birds and flowers .
I had to wait for 45 minutes without nothing doing .
I think that it will be nice about the end-of-conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy oneself and to dance .
Thank you to ask me my taste and to be preoccupied with it .
I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved , bad-tempered , and angry with the world for interfering into their lives .
I 'd like to change a rule at home .
I want to say thank you that I was the lucky person who won that competition .
After the show , I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant , but I could n't because it closed .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
About the Accomodation , I would prefer to sleep on the tents because I never been in one , and it is a lot more fun than log cabins .
" Reading the gossip , " is n't it what anyone of us love doing ?
This story happened a long time ago .
I hope my recommendations will help you in the choice of a building to visit .
However , when I went there , it was closed .
Last month , I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
I have taken a photography course , and I enjoy taking photos to animals .
Someone says it is maths , pratical , and usefull , but the majority says it is boring , unless you 're chosen a job which charges all your math 's knowledge as accounting ; otherwise , you can use a calculator or a computer .
At 20 : 00 , we stopped in a coffee house to eat . The shouted : " 20 : 30 , you all have to be back because the bus will leave . "
I am looking forward to staying in contact with you .
I AM WRITIN TO YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU .
I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July .
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value , but morality and priciples are also being concerned .
As a result , journalists should respect their lives and always write real news .
I went to the theatre last weekend to see " Over the rainbow . "
I have something really exciting to share with you .
I will start an Italian course in August , so it will be impossible for me to leave .
The show has begun later , much more later than your advertisement writes at about 20 : 15 . The show started 45 minutes later .
By the way , I 'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should prepare and how much I should bring with myself .
They just said , " We do n't give money back . "
Otherwise , if you are in a good mood , it will turn into a bad mood .
It 's a great opportunity because , in our fast-developing world , we have to look fashionable , and this kind of show happens quite rare .
Technology is the thing that makes our lives easy .
I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on the 5th April is suitable for you .
However , we had to use the uniform , and we had to study a lot to pass the exams .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me about the two weeks at Camp California that I won .
Thanks a lot for your letter .
Moreover , I practised a lot of aspects of my speciality , for me was the most important real experience .
The technology is essential to our lives ; we need it on each minute on each second .
Regarding your questions , the following are my answers .
The starring had been changed ; the show had started only at 20 : 15 , and there were no discounts available .
So you will enjoy traditional foods , music , dances , and games from all over the world .
According to the advertisement , Danny Brook would be starring , but it was a different actor .
A survey has been done , and the issue is , which subjects ( lessons ) and activities the students think are the most enjoyables .
Well , I tried to do so , but the lady at the desk told me that they were quotas available at that price but were already sold out !
The military technology has affected our lives more than what we think because most of the equipment we use was originally created by those people .
I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars .
When the important day is coming , it says to me .
Paul was wandering whether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words , " I am glad to meet you , Paul . "
From one side , these people chose to become public people .
I would like to travel in July because it is the summer , and the weather is sunny . Moreover , I am totally free during this month .
Besides , we would like to go to the London Fashion And Leisure Show , which was advertised in the newspaper " Metro " yesterday .
I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying clothes .
It would also be very interesting to film the situation during the brake . The smokers in the school yard , the buffett , and the other pupils , who are sitting in front of their tables , write their homework .
Unfortunately , I will be able to go only in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for this dates .
It will be very awful .
I love swimming , and I 've got a scubar diving licence .
Technology nowadays is something everybody has on your own mind .
Do you have any rules at school that make you upset ?
My family loved him and supported us .
and it has free entrance for the students .
Maybe children will not have to go to school ; they just will stay in their rooms and study from computers , some kind of online education .
Secondly , it was supposed to start at 19.30 , but actually started at 20.15 . Forty five minutes later !
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future .
We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people .
Finally , I appreciate your organisation and look forward to hearing from the next International Arts Festival .
All the students in my class are excited about one more thing :
It was n't usual fish ; it was Gold Fish , and it asked him as human . ' Please , let me go and I can do for you anything you want . '
You have to read it yourself . If your cousin likes crime stories , it is a perfect book !
However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March .
When I stay home , I can watch or listen to the radio , e.g. , so the modern technology helps me to spend my free time .
At present , it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have , and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before .
After the play , which turned out to be just as bad as I thought , I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant , but it was closed , and for no reason !
Even if I worked hard on it , I was very surprised to win just the first prize .
Almost everything is connected to computers . for example , education , researching of the universe , and others .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on the 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
Moreover , the play did not start at the time it was supposed to .
The reason for choosing these two activities is that they contrast itself ; I want one more exciting and that asks for more agility and another more calm and relaxing , which asks only for my ability to paint .
We would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hear from you soon .
It is sometimes a real fight who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician .
About two weeks ago , I went to London for a week 's holiday .
Also , they are showing their first play on the 2nd of July .
New technologies and facilities wo n't improve the relationship between people .
Realistic stories thus develop our imagination and creativity , which are essential in our lives .
It 's one of the most important things for me to have a chance to forget about all my present , luxurious life and try doing something different .
Another aspect is that children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention .
To begin with , in your letter , you asked me when I would like to travel .
I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to " the London fashion and leisure show . " on behalf of all the students .
I want to play tennis and swimming .
MY NAME JAMES CAMIREZ AND I'AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLEINTS FOR THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter , which arrived yesterday .
As I did n't expect to be successful , I am very happy with this result .
" What will clothes be like 100 years from now ? "
Each of us had a different task .
I think that it will have a similar structure , but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the houses controlled by a computer so that , for example , we can turn on the lights of the bedroom just pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa .
What do you think about this plan ?
On the last day , I go to your house , and then we think about our conference plane .
Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .
I prefer to live in tents because I feel very natural .
On the other hand , if you think that you 'll be on the red , I 'd better stay at home .
People at the backstage , including me , were helping to clean up all the stuff and ready for the end of the concert .
Mathematics teachers do a great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons .
Finally , I 'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience in my life .
It was not our fault that we went in after 11 p.m .
I am really happy to receive a letter about Camp California from you .
We could n't imagine our lives without them .
I realised that it was a different actor playing instead of Danny Brook .
There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets , which appeared to be wrong .
From the beginning , it was all a disappointment .
Most of them are flats which have at least 20 Floors .
I 'm not quite a young man , and during the past years of my life , I gothave become accostomed to some more comfort .
After a while , she pulled herself together and paused for a minute .
On the other hand , I have never done surfing ; I am a completely Beginer , but I am dieing to do it .
Fashion of the Future
At the ticket office , I also asked for a discount , but they told me this was n't possible ; instead , your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available !
I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included .
I would like to ask if you could expend the plays and films more for next year .
After the show , we went to the theatre restaurant , but it closed .
It made it possible to discover , to talk with new people on the Internet , and to join and to be joined by my friends or parents .
I have n't a clue about it .
I was thinking , " What should I do ? "
When I must buy something , I usually ca n't find it , and then the shopping becomes a nightmare .
Finally , I would like to inquire about how much money I should take with me and what kind of clothes would be most suitable to wear .
So I am very grateful to man who invented it , unfornutely , I have forgotten his name .
Finally , I would like to ask you which kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp , the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me , and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
The salewomen are too busy and have n't a moment for giving you a counth service .
It will begin at 6 o'clock and last until midnight .
I do n't know why , and I 'd like you to tell me , the reason .
We spent two weeks with the family .
They wanted to be famous , and they had known the price before .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert , which I enjoyed helping last month ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I 'm going to help them again .
Also , I would prefer to go swimming and surfing because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool so that I am good at swimming .
In my opinion , shopping is just to cover our basic needs .
Every day , like everybody , I watch the TV , see the international news , hear the radio , play games on my computer , or get across with American or Asian people without going out to my house .
I am one of your husband 's students .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Firstly , I helped sell the tickets .
What is impressive on this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
Finally , could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes , towels , and extra money ?
It 's a good chance for you to improve your English .
The clothes are part of each culture and one of these things , which expresses our taste and personality .
It would be difficult to take more time to make an appointment .
Regarding the end-of-conference party , I would suggest wearing some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man , though , it is no formal do .
We have organised to do the party between three to six o'clock in the afternoon in College Canteen , about food we organised a buffet , but could you also help us with the music which he prefers , if prefer something special ?
I helped at a pop concert of a newcomer group , and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
I would also take an outdoor lesson " training . "
You had to start the show at 19.30 p.m. , but you started too late at 20.15 p.m .
On my first day , I did n't work .
Styles mix , colours , and shapes come back from the past ; only the fabrics are different .
A friend of me gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place .
Unfortunately , the musical show was annoying .
Last before least , I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America .
The queue is not only the problem ; if you go by car , there is parking problem . If you go by bus , there is again queue , and you have to carry many carry bag carrier bags during your journey , and you wo n't be alway luky to find a seat to seat .
But I 'm really happy that I had even a small role in making people enjoy themselves .
I would have informed us before .
The other one is television .
As mentioned above , please take care of giving me more information , and if you 'd like to know more , please telephone me for further discussion .
We often go out to sing in the Karaoke bar .
I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have been paid .
Firstly , what kind of clothes I have to take to the camp , clothes for hot or cold weather ?
I am not really satisfied with it .
First , what clothes should I bring ?
I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you are in New York on holiday .
Sometimes , it is necessary and sometimes not , and overall , it is not always enjoyable .
I did not get a discount .
I know you have a good taste in the present !
It was said that it would start at 19.30 , but it was not .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held .
I am very interested in going to two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world because there are people from six countries .
I am looking forward to travelling .
The purpose that I am writing is due to the fact that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Besides , the theatre restaurant had closed down before I went out of the show .
Tecnology , are we prepeared for those advances ?
However , we have seen an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
A crowded hall is not good to enjoy music .
I have sung in the church 's choir for three years , and I have had singing classes at school since first grade .
Fifty years ago , Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food .
So , I have some opinions about this , which I would like to tell .
Anyway , we still want to go to the Science Museum and shop as well , but we think we can go shopping on the last day afternoon of our trip .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The festival was very well organized with a lot of alternatives , such as concerts and dance shows .
Thank you very much for your letter . I was glad to get it and know a lot of news about you .
I would appreciate it if you supply some towers , if possible .
I would prefer surfing or climbing , but I have to think in my helth .
I was very surprised when I saw that singers are n't so sophisticated and self-confident as they are written in the newspapers .
What is it that we use every day many hours ? Sometime was early in the morning until late in the evening .
I think if we wear these clothes , we will travel to every area easier than we use cars , ships , planes , and space ships .
In the future , it will be able to help people even more since it has been increasing its capacity day after day .
To sum up , I hope the festival is developed next year with an excellent reasonably-priced ticket like this year 's .
The other bad point was the time when the show started ; it was already 20 : 15 when the first star entred on the scene , but your advertisement sayed 19.30 !
People use the telephone also for their personal lives . For example , when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away ,
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology .
I received your letter this morning , and I was very suprised it .
You can not only listen to her best detective stories but also learn English automatically .
The only problem is that on 4 April , I have my graduation .
Modern technology has changed my daily life from physical activity to mental activity .
But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing , for example , bread . On Friedy evening and on the weekdays , each supermarket is crowded .
The activities are quite hard to choose because you have a lot of choices which I like .
Finally , I would like to ask you for some further information about the clothes and the money we will need .
Another problem is that I realised that the discounts were available . However , there was n't any discount .
She is very intelligent .
What we all did was make many cups of coffee and help to find their missing socks or any other clothes .
We can love them without disturbing , too .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Instead of going shopping , we could go to the show .
Besides all those improvements and conditions , I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us .
In every country , there are famous people who are in the middle of the public 's attention .
In addition to this , it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us because for the students , it is completely free .
In conclusion , I think that people who are too much interested in other people 's lives have not an interesting life and are unhappy !
First of all , could you let us know if the date of June 16th is all right with his timetable program ?
What do you think if we go to visit the Arts Museum ?
In 1874 , Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city ( a small town near Savannah ) .
I learned painting when I was a school student .
In conclusion , I wanted to say thanks for such a special weekend .
Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with only that reasonable-priced ticket we paid for all the weekend .
When I was a child , I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked , but it was nearly impossible to have them .
So when I read other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught , I got very angry and annoyed .
On the other hand , I would like to notice that the festival would be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made .
This is an experience that I 'll never forget .
Besides all , at the end of the Musical , I went to the Theatre Restaurant in order to take a dinner because I have leaft home without eating , and so I was hungry at that time .
It closed at 10 p.m. , but the show finished at 10.30 pm .
First of all , I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook , but sadly he was n't there ; he was filled in by a different actor , who was instead rather disappointing .
We lived here in rush , but there was a lot of fun , too .
If I want to buy a nice pair of shoes , I 'll have to go into a city centre and browse around from shops to shops until I find the shoes I like .
However , I have never tried surfing .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
The door is broken , and we can replace it rapidly , and it is not expensive when it is plastic .
Well , I suppose that almost everything in the future house will be automatic and will obey what people say .
I always had my own key and unlock the door by myself .
As for me , the invention , which is most important to me , is a personal computer .
I am writing to tell you about my experience in the last month 's pop concert , where I was helping my friend Nick , who was the bouncer of the place .
Suddenly , a murderer happens !
I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions !
In your advertisement , you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Moreover , once I was going to pay for the tickets , I found another thing : there were no discounts available .
When I neaded some information , I had to go to liblary to find it in books or newspapers .
I am looking forward to your reply letter .
Without a doubt , the discovery of the computer is the most important technological event .
or never living the office , you are able to heat the wather for a hot bath .
I was so disappointed .
I am writing to you in order to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival .
BUT IT WASN'T THE WORSE , BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES TO PLAY ON THE THEATRE .
Your advertisement says " discounts available , " but it was not available .
I am able to meet my friends quickly in the Internet , just clicking the mouse .
Maybe it is right , say that in a flat instead of a building .
Last May , I had a week holiday in London , and during my trip , I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW , the MUSICAL SHOW .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
They are famous , but I think they need to be alone sometimes .
It looked at me and said ,
The director of the college has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion , and I give you the same advice .
They also took me to a after-hour party , and they asked me if I would like to do this again .
due to the fact that my children have summer holiday from July . I prefer to stay in log cabins ; therefore , I 'm going to travel with two children and my dog .
I would rather type some coursework than hand-write it .
Firstly , I found that there were no discounts as it was announced in the advertisement .
It 's like a joke but a bit scarely .
I let this pass , and I bought it anyway , thinking that it was only a mistake in your advertisement .
If it is possible , I would prefer to stay in a log cabins because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollins .
Recently , I visited an arts festival , organized with your help .
or can we find some places to buy it ?
Then , I 'd like to join the activities , swimming and singing .
Finally , I helped them ; in return , I had good experience as well as enjoyed listening music .
No doubt , she would never ever look at me again .
We have to think about this .
Where 's the fun in that ?
I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances .
During break time , I did give a lot of direction to people who ca n't find toilet and information such as where they could have a cup of coffee .
The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer .
If not , you can go on Saturdays , but badly , there are too costumers . You ca n't walk ; try clothes ; it 's very hot .
I was really great .
I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference .
The show finished late .
I look forward to seeing you .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
probably because their parents have n't enough time to go out of the city and show them nature .
The Barbican Centre was built in 1975 . Apart from banks and important offices ,
I am now writing this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure .
These things provide me all convenience .
I have given much information about the international student conference .
So , in fact , people 's homes became more confienence and comfortabler .
Finally , could you tell me how far the nearest town or village is ?
Is it hot enough ?
On top of this , we intend to go to the theatre restaurant , which was closed because of building activities .
Lastly , it could be nice to students who are interested in arts if you help special events , for instance , song contest , writing competitions , or dance lessons .
Even though I had planned something else to do , I agreed because she 's my very good friend .
From any point of view , the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today .
First , I tell you the name of the hotel ; it 's the Palace Hotel .
It has been so long since I wrote to you for the last time .
Anyway , I 'll tell you about my wonderful experience , which I enjoyed at a pop concert .
Nowadays , it 's getting obvious that designers sold only details , but significant changes do n't turn up .
This event was not what I call " a perfect evening out , " as your advertisement promised .
The group had the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting everyone with BB guns .
The biggest disadvantage is pollution .
In addition to this , the show did not start on time , 19 : 30 , so I had to wait for 45 minutes .
The designer will have a lot of ideas for how to make very nice and useful clothes .
To begin with , the actor you publicised was going to perform .
I think it was water .
I am really looking forward to taking part in Camp California .
The maching was used for reading this cad was too big you used to need a room UNKNOWN our computer .
The end-of-conference party is designed to give rough ideas about many different cultures .
There , we will have the chance to be maked up or to try new hairstyles , too .
Because the London Fashion programme takes place on Tuesday , I would suggest changing your plan .
I immediately say " yes " and also my friend .
I understood you want to know when am I available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
At first , I felt really annoyed and disappointed , so I ran to my brother in order to explain him what I had seen .
She will come to Liverpool next week , and I 'll put her up .
I am writing to complain about a musical show I went one week ago .
It contains a wide range of activities , such as sightseeing , river trips , visiting science museum and gallery , and shopping .
I feel entitled to compensation for this event .
Thank you for organising the trip to London .
Secondly , could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents ?
The most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you according to the things you like to do .
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU IN A VERY NEAR FUTURE .
If you have , please tell me .
Pat told him that I was in love with him .
Perhaps there will be personal computers , which will control everything , every item of furiture , light , and temperature .
It was unbelievable and tiring , as well .
Last but not least important is the class called " know-how , " which shows students how to cope with unspected problems even if they are in stress .
I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring .
I am writing to give information on a very interesting building to visit .
I hope I 'll be able to travel in July . due to the fact that my children have summer holiday from July .
I hope we join the next pop concert together as a stuff and enjoy our time !
So , you see my point .
I hope this is n't affending you too much .
Thank you very much for many interesting positions in this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are shure , will be very exciting .
I know they are not like us .
In general , the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools .
All the rubbish , dust , dirty dishes , plates , and caps will be washed and cleaned automatically .
" You see , I am a mere product of your mind , but I would like to go out of the Heavy Sleep .
The restaurant should have been oppened when I came out , but it was closed because of the hour the show finished .
I am just coming back from a week 's holiday in London , which has been all in all really nice .
Let me know if you are going to come so that I prepare the bedroom to put you up .
In addition , we are fascinated in their marriage , children , holidays , etc .
The people who were there to watch the show were very ungry , and they were shouting because they were waiting for too long , and I absolutely agree with them .
You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have , buying clothes , jewells , furniture , etc . and you could have a real great time .
However , the positive way new technology has changed my life is in way to communicate .
Firstly , I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment with your musical show , but it was not the case .
waiting for your replay .
I would also like to know some more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money that will be necessary for me to take .
So , you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
You should review the advertisements you do because you give the wrong information .
However , we saw an advertisement , and we are keen on the idea of going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Her boyfriend , Guy Richie , was there too , and he 's a really good person .
I preferred to come at 19 : 30 because it was better at night , and it would n't finish late , but the theatre started at 20 : 15 , and we got bored waiting to start .
Communications move the world and famous people use them to improve their work , politicians for their campain , and film stars to make famous their last movies .
No matter that , people started to worsen more about polution in the world .
A couple of weeks later , my sister called me as I was at work ; completely devastated and weaponed scalding tears ; she could hardly pronounce a word .
For getting from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St . James College , where the conference will take place .
Anyway , what you wanted to know was what has been my job .
We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place while we visit London on the 14th of March .
And it 's not ending . I hope that for my thirties , I 'll go to Mars on holidays ...
At the end of the summer , we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia .
This is a precise letter that I write you now .
There are some things I would like to ask : the tipe ( and quantity ) of Clothes I will have to take , if it is necessary to take some money and any additional stuff ( like raincoates ) .
Everything is easy now .
So , it would be grateful if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
Another important thing is that , despite the number and quality of films , there were , from my point of view , not many plays .
My job was very easy . I had to help Sting in everything . For example , if he wanted water , I had to give to him water ; it was marvellous .
Thank you for your answer .
But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt whether to use it or not . Especially now , when ' big-mouth ' Pat spread the news to litterally everyone .
In this domain , you have to afford the development of new technology every day .
When the play " over the Rainbow " finished , I tried to eat something , but the fact was that the theatre restaurant was closed because your personnel were cleaning all the troubles that an old dog did .
I would like to travel in July because , during that period , I will be free from work . My current post finishes at the end of June , but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
First of all , I recommend you to go on the 8 a.m. boat .
In my opinion , technology has made human life easily , funier , and more comfortable .
Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Probably , she 'll come with a friend if you want you to enjoy us .
Technology allows us to have more time to distractions or to other things we really like .
Home made out of plastic also windows made out of plastic ; therefore , we can have our home for a long time .
He or she can just press the button or send an e-mail to operate what he / she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .
I am writing to express my dissapointment about the play " over the rainbow , " which is performing at Circle Theatre .
It was n't very pleasant .
Then , I can prepare my clothes suitable for that weather .
So , I wanted to know if there will be more films next year .
Every person in the world looks for technology every day to improve the way they live their own lives .
It felt to be a good memory to remember and remind our sleves to speak in a correct way .
However , sometimes I ask myself if the " ancient world " , without science , technological discoveries and industries was more authentic than the one .
Concerning Singing activities , I think I 'm quite good as I have been in my school 's choir for three years .
I said " yes , " and I am sure it was the best decision of my life .
I like water painting .
I appreciate these shops for lots of products , cheep prices , and end big spaces .
It is also expensive , and I ca n't afford to stay there too long .
Here are the information that you asked me for :
Also , change my free time . They had invented great games like play stations , and you can have a really good time with your friend playing .
Actually , they came from only six countries .
I really disappointed from the different actors ' performances .
This way , we could obtain seldom places at NASA university .
All of them were worried about what they heard . As well as this , they started to talk about it everywhere .
It is a good start to go on sightseeing by bus on Monday morning . We can see all famous buildings in a few hours .
Personally , I do n't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops , so I buy all what I can use " on-line " services .
Finally , it was a very nice day with great experience .
I think that if we mix lessons with sports activities , the combination will give us complete success .
I 'm sure we will find another solution .
I do n't like tinking , my house of my life , without all these facilities . In winter , when it is dark very early , I need to spend my free time at home .
One story is about ten persons who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
However , I go far away from my family and other people and have virtual relationships .
I hope you will enjoy it .
I helped setting up the sound equipment , programming the light system on the computer , and tidy up Madonna 's room !
We prepared some special attraction , like live dance music and hot or cold buffet .
I was very surprised by the result of the competition .
He actually went to Carla and told her everything .
As you can see , most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided .
I 'm very happy and lazy at the same time .
For example , the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor , but he was not .
This could save life !
Althoug I , which is my accommodation at Camp California , must be in tents . I have experience last summer .
I would ask you to my money back .
I think it was very cleaver of me to record that moment , which I will never ever forget , and that was the think that I was more liked of that experience .
Based on everything listed above , I would like to receive £10 , which I have paid back .
Unfortunately , it could have been inconvenient for me because of pollution from cars and factories .
Furthermore , the show started at the wrong time .
During it , everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers of the conference .
It changed every day , and I do not know if we will be able to understand it .
Then , by some ' strange power ' , my left foot was moving , and I wanted to stop it , but it was too difficult .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT. 10 MINUTES AFTER I WAS FOLLOWING HIM , I START KNOWING THE PLACE , AND I WAS FELLING MORE CONFORTABLE .
After waiting a while in this uncomfortable place , the show started . I waited for 45 minutes , and then the actors appeared , but I found myself that the main one was n't Danny Brook ; it was an impostor .
We know what you have done , and your dog will be sold . "
However , I must say that it was quite the opposite .
Who of you could imagine life without the telephone ? Do you not be able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
Well , that would be all .
The purpose of this letter is to let you know my opinion of the event .
Last month , I helped at a pop concert ; it was marvellous .
Fortunately , the people from my class are really great , and we all love trips - especially interesting ones .
It is very useful .
To make the matter worse , I had expected the ticket with some discount , but when I went to the ticket box , there was no discounts available .
By choosing this style of life , they should realise how their life would look like .
I did n't get involved that much in writing a script because it was very hard , and the director wrote most of it , but the main idea of the background of the stage was my , and I am very proud of it .
Is there only one teatcher for each sport , and how many are we in each group of activities ?
" Yes , Oh Lord , he did it because we won his team at football , " Nick said .
I am very good at playing basketball .
First of all , I will be able to travel in July because I have not finished school .
Also , in the advertisement , you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't , and also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show , to eat some thing or to have a drink .
In conclusion , if you go shopping reasonably , have a good time .
There are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight , moonlight , and candle light .
Now then , how was this advertising ? It was completely diffarent . I am really disappointed in your musical . I am asking you for money back because I did n't enjoy your musical .
Modern technology has changed my daily life in many aspects .
I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends .
I go to the swimming-pool two times by week , so I am good at this sport .
When I was younger , I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project , I would take a lot of time researching on libraries , looking for old books .
I was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
From my point of view , people 's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer that is devised in every machine , TV , cooker , and the light , connecting to the owner .
so they can be just ordinaly people like us .
When you work in an office , a manufactory , and a society , you have the same planning to them . You just can go to do a shopping during your lunch break .
My name is John , and I have been in the latest International Arts Festival .
As I told you in my last letter , I worked two weeks ago in Edinburgh , helping at a pop concert .
I went to the International Arts Festival on 21-22 November .
I was really excited with the idea of seeing that show .
I am willing to show you the authograph and the photograph .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I 've never been to California ; therefore , please let me know about the weather there .
The shopping is great when you have lots of money and time ; you can buy clothes , shoes , make-up , CD , or whatever .
Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed by 20 : 15 .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definitely need one , and it holds true for the class on politics because you have to study statistics on your computer for doing social research and some analysys .
Please send me a list of the items I need there , including the most appropriate clothes for the American weather .
I was terribly disappointed .
Celular phone can be inconvenient sometimes , but it can be very useful in certain situations : when your car is broken on the road , when you need to be found anywhere and at any time ( if you are a doctor , a lawyer , or a journalist , for instance ) , and so forth .
To make things even worse , the play did n't start at 19 : 30 as it was supposed to , but instead , it started 45 minutes late , at 20 : 15 , and there were n't even your famous discounts available .
I chose singing because I love singing , and I am in a choir for seven years now .
I am writing in response to it .
At the camp , I would like to choose two activities : Painting and Singing . I love painting . In the university , I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint couse . I work in a bank , and I have a baby . .
I would like to inform you about the London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday , 14th March at 10.00 - 19.00 .
As well as this , the stories are going to be read in English .
I am writing to provide you with the information you require .
About the activities while at the Camp , I would like to enjoy swimming , not because I am good in it , just because I am keen on , and the other one is photography .
So , try to imagine my situation . I had paied a lot of money , and I could n't see a good show . I am really disappointed .
There is one thing I would like to ask you : It 's about how much money I will need to go out at night , to spend with food , and this kind of thing .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing .
I 'm writing to express my feelings and opinions about the International Arts Festival , which held a few days ago .
I am writing to complain about the musical show I have seen last Friday in your theatre .
Also , you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue trousers or a beautiful black dress , for example .
It depends on every individual to change your mind and act as a " smart " shopper .
It starts already in the morning that we wake up by the sound of an alarm clock , then in the bathroom we have running hot water , and also , the hole house is warm due to central heating .
Finally , my parents are all the time , arguing different solutions to my problem , and this all thanks to Pat .
I am writing to complain about your musical show .
Maybe you will spend all your money for a new thing , and a few hours later , your best friend will invite you to go to night club , but you are short of money .
I think I would prefer cubing and painting .
I have to choose painting and photography .
Should I bring my camera , warm clothes , or any pocket money ?
I could be interested in your letter .
The pop group were all young people ( between 23 and 30 years old ) , and all of them were really nice .
During all the day , I speak with the majority of my colleagues by telephone or e-mail .
I 'm writing you to follow our visit last night .
One day , while all their friends were there and talking , Pat told everyone that Pandora had done a robbery .
Thank you very much for your letter .
However , there are some notes that you should improve in the next year 's festival to make it absolutely wonderful .
By the way , I 've understood I had better trust in nobody .
How much do I have to bring the money ?
First off all , I would like to say that it has started later than it should . I had to wait for about four minutes .
We have to face it - it has both sides .
I think that housewives will receive more help with a robotor in the household .
Between males and females will be not important for clothes in 100 years ' time .
I had to wait all that time in the street because the hall was not big enough .
You asked me about my experiences .
What do you want more ?
Your dance shows are very beautiful ; art exhibitions are something original and exciting .
I am very glad that I have won first prize in your competition , and I can go to the United States .
The restaurant should open until the show finishes .
If you have more questions about the conference and something else , do not hesitate to ask me .
Although jazz , rock , and classical music were great , some concerts and halls were too small . Could you consider making them bigger next year ?
For accommodation , I would prefer a tent , as I love nature , and I like going camping a lot .
What is the weather ?
Lastly , the restaurant that was going to be opened was , in fact , closed without a reason !
I 'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday , where " The old man and the Sea " by Earnest Hemingway will be read .
My daily life should be changed by these innovations .
The organiser of the concert asked my school for about 15 people who did art to help decorate the stage .
I CAN NOT EXPRESS HOW THANFUL I AM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PRIZE .
One of the most important things we have to film is our bycicle classes . Our school is now the best of the country in all ages . We are prest with this ; we can show what we do in order to be the best .
But she did , she asked me out .
People have seen in the last 10 years how diferent our clothes have become .
For the activities , I would like to choose the Tennis activities , which I am not too bad at and climbing , which I have never done but must be interesting .
Of course , the furnitures of people 's homes will not change as well .
After the show , we went immediately to the tickets office for asking money back , but they were too strict and close-minded .
It was a big fault to give her a secret , especially an important one .
With the help of some modern technology , our daily lives would not be so difficult .
It always happens with people , does n't ?
We imagine that it would be the best holidays in our lives .
They started charging down the field towards the fire , and once in range , everyone knew their balloon as far as they could .
Moreover , there were not any discounts , and all of the tickets had the same prizes .
I sometimes want to hear their voices on the telephone .
The season for this is global warming , which is the salvation of the problem and another reason why this idea is possible .
I helped with the selling of the tickets , with the security , with the designing ...
In addition , the resort has an interesting history background about arquitectory and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico . For example , it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico .
On the other hand , during my stay in Camp California , I want to go swimming because I practice this activity regularly , and I often do competitions . This is one of my hobbies .
It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp .
I look forward to receiving your reply soon .
Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone .
In my opinion , it should be a rule that lets the media approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe .
To sum up , it is a big school where you have a lot of interesting lessons and some optionaly activities to do in your free time .
First of all , we are happy to win the first prize on your competition .
I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan .
Choosing gave me such a big pleasure because I never have to worry about whether I take money for my wishes .
Eventually , I would like to ask you about money and clothes .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July only because I have two months of holiday , which are July and August . I choose July because it is the only one month that I think I 'm free .
Firstly , it is a good idea that the Festival is international .
Do you know " Radio Head " ?
Moreover , they will be able to create a special climate for each room .
Another point is the time when it started , exactly 45 minutes later .
About the accommodation at Camp California , I would like to stay in a tents .
As you look for , everybody has a car or motorcycle .
I hope you will understand my disappointment and the reasons why I ask for my money back .
On the other hand , people will still have to programmed them as they have to do nowadays .
I was wondering which kind of clothes we need and what about money and meals . Are they provided ?
Finally , we should film the lunch , which is also a moment to relax for the students , and for the teatchers , we must n't forget to film the teatcher room because if a school is made of students , it 's also made of teatchers .
The tickets were a little expensive , but I was with other TEN people , so when we read " Discounts Available , " we expected that the theatre had organised a special discount for a group of numerous people .
The two activities I have chosen are basketball and tennis .
So , what are we going to do ?
If only I could sing beautifully !
However , you changed actors without informing viewers .
In addition , I would like to talk about the success among most visitors of the weekend ticket due to its economical price and because of its comodity in use .
First of all , I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
When the band had just started to play , lots of girls started to jump the faints getting very close to them . Some of the girls started to take their clothes off , which was the best part for me , but some of the securities went there and took them away .
It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy ; shops are plenty of all kinds of things .
Secondly , there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small .
We have seen your programme , and like all of those , especially the Science Museum , it will be good for us to increase our knowledge and so on .
In the future , they both get closer and closer .
Last , I have no experience abroad . Therefore , I 'd like to know about the weather in California in July .
To conclude , in this short video , we must show that thanks to our school , we are able to make come out the best of ourselves .
Both of them are my favorite sports , and I 'm quite good .
Do you know that this concert will be on television ?
It was a very good programme , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class would enjoy .
I am very happy to know I won the prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A .
When the show started , the person who was acting it was not Danny Brook , and he seemed not to be an actor .
It is well-known in almost all families , often with a lot of different cannels .
Hey Listen guys , we will take his dog , which loves very much , and we will sell it to Sally who wants one .
Firstly , I was designed to sell the tickets .
After that , a being climed out from the potato .
Her family was very rich , and a lot of men wanted to marry to her .
But there 's something that I 'd like to ask .
It will take place on Tuesday , March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall , from 10.00 to 19.00 .
As you know , I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents ' house , but that Sunday I was driving when suddenly I saw in the lay-by one excellent car .

He fought in the Spanish Civil War and in World War II always on the search for answers to questions like " ... what defines a man , " or " ... what happens to us in critical situations . "
To sum up , the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group .
So , you can see that it was not a perfect evening for me , then I thought .
It is my favourite group .
I received your letter last Monday .
However , it was closed for cleaning .
Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money . Usually , much more money we spend than we expect .
I am finishing my study in June , and then I have a month off ( July ) , and on August 1st , I am starting a new job .
It 's brilliant , is n't it ?
This is important for everybody , and I think this is important for them , too .
They said that it was n't necessary , and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenary was being prepared for the concert .
Thank you for chooping our ticket at the final .
Her daughter , Lourdes Maria , is such a pretty little girl that I could n't take my eyes off of her .
I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year .
