It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
First of all you said that the star would be Danny Brook but it was not .
I think it 's a great opportunity because we will have a chance to see the latest fashion , leisure - and sport wear , as well as the way to do perfect makeup and hairstyles .
But to solve this problem , we may think first about its origin ...
The Computer was invented 30 years or more ago and started by processing information with a big card . This was performed by making small holes in the card , and each hole meant something like code .
First , we will use new technologies like telecommunication or internet more often .
If people want to enjoy shopping , we must consider before buying something - do I really want it ?
As a teenager , I must admit that there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping .
I think if you have lots of money and do n't know what to do with it , do not go shopping ; give the money to charity . That is better than shopping .
You can choose the price most suitable for you .
As modern technology is changing the world rapidly , I think we are all involved in the revolution it 's causing .
And also the ticket discounts were not available .
I hope you will find my letter of interest , and I look forward to seeing you .
That was not what your advertisement had shown .
Food and beverages will be available .
I hope that my advice will help you .
Thank you for your attention .
After working 30 minutes , a singer appeared .
Firstly , despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring , another actor starred in the actual show , and his performance was literally horrible and disappointing .
Another point is that , with the help of technology , we can communicate with the whole world .
We 're always wanting to know about others ' lives , especially famous people , even the ones that we hate .
Now , I have two questions about camping .
The best thing was I spoke in English because I was forgetting it , and I met my favorite singer .
Well , I would be available only in July because at that time I would be on winter vacation .
I am looking forward to the meeting with you and our mutual work during the conference .
One can get to the city center with the No.456 bus and then on foot to the castle .
One night , I heard a strange sound .
It all comes from my parents .
But this problem is being solved by itself .
Thank you for everything .
The next morning as Pat was going to school , he met Bad Jon and told him , " Hey , you .
The fans and the press have made them rich and famous .
We thought that we could change the program this way : we could go to the Science Museum Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
You certainly saw that plays and films had a lot of success .
So she asked me to fill her position .
Shopping is when someone goes to the shop and buys what they want . However , I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes and all sort of things .
In the past , everything was very different .
I have just two questions .
The aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resort building , which was built 10 years ago and is one of the first buildings that was built with the latest technology and designed by an important Mexican architect .
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
You also asked me about two activities .
I also wanted to know if I have to take some money to buy souvenirs and food or will that be paid for me too ?
Finally , I have questions about clothes and money .
I 'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize .
Thank you very much .
Secondly , if you happen to forget something , you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers , and that can take up even more time .
Some time before , I did not know of the internet .
How has modern technology changed our daily lives ?
It was so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice .
Indeed , instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ; we had mean actors .
Of course , if everyone pays less attention or interest , the situations should be better .
It was an absolutely fantastic prize .
I am the representative of our class in your college to write to you .
The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines ; so today 's children must be introduced to computers from an early age so that they can have a chance to compete with the furious emergence in the future .
When I saw your advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you have written in your advertisement .
In addition , it would be nice if you could send me an address at which I am going to stay , so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family .
The entrance for students is free .
I also would like to talk about your concerts .
I ca n't go to the town center of a big city .
Finally , I choose to travel there in July because I am not allowed to take vacations on other months due to my work .
I 'm really happy to hear from you !
Actually , I 've just done light and sound for drama day at my school at the end of last term .
Yesterday as I was arriving home I saw him in your yard , Mack . He looked very satisfied , Curly was laying on the grass and ... "
I also choose climbing .
Afterwards , I decided to go for a meal in the theater restaurant , but it was closed .
I will be expecting to hear from you .
His acting was not good and he did n't seem like an actor . My son could act better .
Now my dream will come true .
I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre 's " Over The Rainbow . "
Everything in fashion passes away in a couple of months and has to be created again .
Write to me soon and tell me if you want to join us for 2001 .
LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH MY MOTHER .
I 've always enjoyed the hazard , and this time getting the password was , indeed , a tough cookie .
I apologize for any inconvenience , and I am waiting for your reply .
I was just walking down by the dressing room , and the manager asked if I could help them .
The performances were great , but some halls were too small to accommodate as many people there were that day .
At first , I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor , but he must have been changed since the actor was different .
It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming .
Is it a very expensive area ?
I am pleased to have the opportunity to practice sports as well .
In my opinion , in the future , people will wear clothes made of all-natural fabrics : silk , cotton , leather , wool .
I would like to travel in June , as I have already arranged for a part-time job later this summer .
Firstly , the actors were n't those announced .
What can I bring to match the weather ?
What I realized was they were not different from any of us , but they were called celebrities .
I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time .
Now I am happy to give you all the information you need .
Also , I prefer sleeping in a tent than in a long cabin because it is easier to clean .
We think and talk about it with our families .
My name is Paula , and I 'm one of your latest visitors to your show " Over the Rainbow . '' This is also the reason of my letter .
There are many historical buildings remaining .
Can you guess whom who they chose for the work ? " Me , " yes me . I could n't believe it .
Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colors was , I consider myself to have been very successful .
All of a sudden , a weird creature popped into his dream .
Technology has changed our daily life ; it makes our life easier to live and , of course , more comfortable , like with computers , televisions , radios , etc. , and sometimes more secure , like in medicine .
I was very happy because this time I had a chance to talk to them and get to know more about them .
Everybody is free to dress for the party , but please be appropriate .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Amazingly , doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time : shopping can give you a large variety of undesirable pains .
To be honest , the next great invention of the people , the computer , ca n't work if you have n't got the phone .
At work , we have the most important thing in the world of technology , the computer . Without that , we ca n't do anything today .
According to the advertisement I have seen , it is supposed to show the latest fashions , leisure - and sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles .
I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If I find something special to visit in three hours , I 'll call you .
I like to face people whom even I do n't know .
I would like to try it this time .
The first week was fine , but the second week I got very sick .
It was very sorry news for Richard Brown .
During my vacation in London , I went to see your musical .
I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the information that you have asked of me .
Secondly , I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kinds of music , but in this case the main problem was that some concert halls were too small , and because of it I could n't see one of the concerts in the program .
I got their address , so we can visit them one day .
Technology is in every part of our lives .
Even if my parents do n't look after me for all those things , like going out at night , or studying , do n't think that living in my house is like living in heaven , because I ca n't play the guitar , or listen to loud music , or invite my friends over for a Saturday night party .
I was with a few of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town .
We would be terribly grateful if you accepted our offer .
However , the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London , where the latest fashions will be shown .
NOBODY TOLD US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES , AND WE WANT YOU TO GIVE US THE MONEY BACK .
Please give this your careful consideration .
Apart from this , the computer 's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to , while five years ago when I did not have a computer , I had to write letters , which was a slower way to contact people .
I just imagined what it was like to be a singer .
This is a very interesting question for us , and maybe very important too .
It was a kind of map that showed the place for a lot of money , which the robbers had hidden .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend you visit the historical museum !!!
Everyone in the school was so jealous .
But you wo n't believe who the singer was ... it was Sting , can you imagine ?
Secondly , technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do a lot more things than before .
All of us must notice this fact .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because I got a new job and ca n't ask for more than one month off each year , and during the other months , I will be very busy because my coworkers will take off during these months .
And also it is very interesting to talk with writers .
Both of them are equally as convenient for getting there .
I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won , and I am writing to you to give you all the details you need .
Finally , I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after the show , but it was closed because the interior was being refurbished .
I arrived in Ireland on July 2 .
I saw the musical show in your advertisement on my vacation .
However , it also can make our life very lazy .
I am writing to complain about the musical " Over the Rainbow . "
In the end , he wins , but before he is able to get back , he has to " sacrifice " his fish to attacking sharks .
It was like a dream .
I really think it sounds so interesting .
I would like to go only in July because I have had my time off set for this month since last January .
It is going to be very lovely and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises for the students .
Unfortunately , it was used to kill a lot of people .
They were replaced by less famous actors .
This year , I started a private school in Dijon .
It is a famous exhibition , where the latest fashions , leisure - and sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles are shown .
I feel free as an eagle .
I 've got other questions : What type of clothes do I have to bring ?
If it does not seem like enough , after the show , my boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theater 's restaurant , but the unpleasant surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on vacation .
At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must wear nice clothes ; jeans are not allowed .
In the end , I was happy that I had done this job .
At home , young people should help their parents do some housework .
Therefore , we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect all in their privacy .
You will understand how upsetting all this was . And I decided to visit your restaurant , thinking that could save my visit to the theater , but it was closed , and I had to go back to my hotel feeling mad and hungry .
What I really want to say is about my recent experience .
The party will finish quite late , so we 've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely .
So men have invented machines to help them with their tasks , but nowadays , we are becoming slaves to them .
Next weekend I have an appointment with one of them , but I wo n't tell you the name because you 'll feel jealous !
First , I would like to travel in July , because before then I do n't have time to travel .
Neighbors have complained about loud music .
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression .
Speaking of my work , I had to mostly make the concert stage with some fellows .
People had completely different lifestyles .
Another thing I have to complain about is the time of the theater .
Another sport I love is basketball .
Among all these , the theater restaurant was closed because the chef and the waiters were on vacation .
I think you never realize this until you 're not a part of the crowd .
We could listen for free !
It would be a great opportunity because , for students , it 's free .
They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party .
I am writing from Paris , where I live .
I look forward to hearing from you soon , and if you could send me a brochure of this holiday , I would be grateful .
I still believe it has only been a dream !
I never imagined I would have to face this situation .
There are many indispensable electrical appliances , such as televisions , radios , fax machines , and microwaves .
Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss about in the past , present , and future .
It was the very last day of my trip , and at that time I was in Kyoto .
I can really recommend this book to you ; it is fabulous .
Clothes used to be made of cotton , but nowadays we can see shirts , pants , socks .... made of almost everything .
At the end of conference , there is a party , a perfect opportunity for your students to meet new friends from all parts of the world , and they could speak about their experience .
Firstly , I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing , as your advertisement already said , but there was a different actor instead of him that evening .
I am waiting for your reply .
I 'm writing to complain about your current musical , which I saw last week .
You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference ; it only takes ten minutes approximately .
As you know , I finished school two years ago .
I would like to travel in July , because it is the only month that I will be able to take off days .
I would like to ask you what type of clothes I should bring .
I mean , all those flashing lights , their changing colors , I believe they helped a lot .
In the winter you 'll freeze .
It could be an advantage !
They will bounce on roads with their balloon clothes .
The second reason is the weather .
Yes , it is the TV .
How is your sister , Marine ?
On the other hand , I would like to request all details of the accommodations and if you could specify what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to bring .
I also recommend window shopping .
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
The conference will be held in The Royal Hall , and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus .
We will pay Curly 's doctor with this money that we will earn , " Pat said .
Another thing was that the show I went to was to start at 19 : 30 , but it started at 20 : 15 !
I am allowed to take off only in July .
Please , bring me with you , in your reality ! "
If I use e-mail , it is much easier and cheaper . And I can send e-mails anytime .
I hope all the best for you !
I prefer that kind of accommodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but I ca n't have that in a tent .
Because of this situation , I will be very busy the first week of July , and I would appreciate it if you could give me the choice to start my " Camp California " on July 10th .
" He is so bad .
In fact , there would be only one possibility , in July , because I will finish my exams at the end of this month and begin a practical training the 1st of August .
Therefore , I would like to have my money back .
Unfortunately , your advertisement for it was n't true !
If you choose this post , you will be exhausted thoroughly at the end of the concert .
Can you believe that I was helping in the last Britney Spears Concert ?
Anyway , I think that 's it for now .
At the end , in my opinion , it would be interesting to film a course on sports in order that our parents realize that we improve our body 's abilities and not only our brain 's abilities at school .
Thank you very much for this occasion . I 'd like to travel only in July , because , during the rest of the year , I 'm working at a bank .
Could I suggest that you consider changing the program ?
Anything as a souvenir would be quite enough for me .
I have to add that the weekend ticket was an ideal idea to sell all the events .
Consequently , I hope that it is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July , when the company I work with suspends its activities .
But we have to accept that everyone has their private life ; for example , when we get married or when a policeman stops us on the highway , we do n't want any strangers to notice what is happening to us .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
I really do n't know why she behaved so badly during her interview .
I would prefer to live in the tent cabin , as I think it is more comfortable .
It closed at 11 pm .
Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me .
This is mostly because I have a job , and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months .
But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time .
I want you to know what extraordinary moments I spent with my friends at the festival .
Lastly , I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect , and I would be glad if you could pay me some money back .
I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY GRADES WOULD BE GOOD .
Your freezer tells you when you have to buy milk , eggs , or cheese .
I really got to know them after the concert .
From the list of all activities , I have chosen photography and golf .
Furthermore , sometimes you can not find a variety of goods , and you eventually buy a low-quality product .
There are links between the greenhouse , technology , and me .
In the advertisement for the show , you said that one of the starring actors was going to be Danny Brook , and to my surprise , it was a different actor , and it really disappointed me .
Today , I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine .
During the afternoon , Tim and I spent the hours before the concert lying in the park next to the sports hall where the concert was to be held .
We saw an advertisement about the Fashion And Leisure Show .
However , I have some proposals about improving it next year .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
We bought the tickets and then we sat down to rest .
Or think you can contact anyone who is from any country whenever you want ?
Pat went to Anna 's , and she seemed really unhappy .
Therefore , people are used to shopping weekly or monthly .
So , I am going to choose golf and tennis .
Fortunately , it is not far from our college .
Believe it or not , I put makeup on one famous singer 's face .
They are filled with people who want to buy everything .
There is a storm , and they can not leave .
On the other hand and as a conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living surrounded by lots of gadgets with different functions .
He kept forgetting his lines .
Fist of all , it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is the hottest month in the year , and the weather shall be really nice .
It was our family 's secret .
I learned from your letter that I 've won the first prize .
We had been trapped in the snowy , almost vertical slopes of the " Tête Blanche " for more than ten hours by then .
It seems like it 's been ages since I wrote to you .
During my time in California , I would love to have the chance for some leisure activities such as swimming . It is my favorite sport .
For this prize , I can choose two activities , ca n't I ?
Firstly , there was a different actor instead of the famous actor , Danny Brook .
In my opinion , staying in log cabins is funnier and much cleaner .
I am not satisfied with your show , as it was completely different from the advertisement .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
On my third day , I helped them install the sound system .
Although the show was supposed to be London 's newest and best musical show , I am rather disappointed with it .
First of all , the principal character was not Danny Brook , but a substitute , and the theater had not notified the audience about this change beforehand .
I could n't have imagined if I had been caught .
Secondly , I supposed the show would start at 19 : 30 , but it started at 20 : 15 .
We can take care of those we love and give them more attention ; time is not really a problem .
That is why I would like to do that .
Well , it was the best time of my life !
However , the press should n't create rumors and hunt those people like animals .
If you have any time left you ought to go to the High Street , where you can go shopping .
And it tells about their attitude to life and about their character .
Students start their day at the gym , where they learn the importance of being fit ; that is why I suggest filming this activity .
I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time very much .
I also would like to get some information about the weather .
As I saw from your advertisement in the newspaper , it said " Starring : Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . "
Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills , making this a trip to remember .
And the restaurant of the theater was being painted , so I could not go as you said in the advertisement .
In the future , we wo n't buy clothes by size or even color ; our clothes will adapt to our body , the weather , our fit , our necessities .
I mean , would £700 be enough for me for one week ?
Thank you very much for your letter from 1/6/00 . I was really amazed at the news that I 'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
You know he is my favorite singer .
I was very disappointed !
What you expect when you go shopping , generally with a friend or two , is to wander around and look at everything .
We 're waiting for your answer . Receive our greetings .
Do you know what , Kim ? I 've never thought before that enjoying yourself like this could be weird .
I am really surprised that I have won .
What do you think about that ?
But the differences between the homes of the rich and the poor will be the same in the future .
Luckily , I could keep my secret for a couple of days , but then it became urgent and I needed someone to talk to .
I did n't have my mobile phone with me , and I was halfway between my school and home .
I thank you very much for hearing my request . I apologize for any inconvenience it could make . I am certain you will think over that particular visit to the " London Fashion and Leisure Show , " on behalf of all the students .
The party will be nice .
Firstly , I would like to mention that in our daily lives we always use some technological machine , for instance , TV sets , stereos , microwave ovens , and others .
If it would be possible , we can make an interview with the last winner .
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
Nonetheless , people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake .
I am looking forward to receiving your reply with my money .
The most important thing is the figure , such as having long legs or being pear-shaped .
We were allowed to go out if we did n't want to stay in class .
I told you that I helped at a pop concert last month .
In regards to your International Arts Festival advertisement , I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take into consideration .
All I ought to do is buy and choose .
Firstly , I have to say that I can travel only in July this year .
The reason for my choosing singing is because I feel embarrassed about my voice , so maybe I could get better .
When I saw the advertisement of the show , it was written that the show would start at half past seven , but it started at a quarter past eight .
Afterwards , they talk talked to me and thanked me for helping them in those exciting moments .
Thirdly , the disappointment made me a bit hungry , but the restaurant was closed without any sign saying why .
We think that , if you do n't have any problem with it , we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
As you know , I am a member of a BSB fan club , and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live .
I think it can make your festival more popular .
Back in the '30s , different governments invented guns , battleships , and all kinds of weapons for their armies .
That 's why I 'd like to ask if you could give me some money back .
As well as all the treasures , statues , and historical paintings , there are also restaurants and modern galleries .
In spite of our decadence , some cheap souls still have the courage to say that , by shopping , they 're filling their empty spaces .
The bus will be in service from 9.30 PM until 11.30 PM , and at the end of the party will be the last one .
I was disappointed when I found out the actor was n't Danny Brook !
Consequently , I proposed to change the program as follows : on Tuesday afternoon , instead of shopping , we could go to this show , and we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon during our free time .
But while reading realistic stories , I fall deep into the story , into the writer 's own world .
Hopefully I will meet some other girls in the same sport so that we all play as a team .
I always dreamed about going to California , and now my dreams are coming true .
Do you want to join me ?
The computer is very useful , and it has affected our own lives in different ways .
It can show how much students are enjoying their lives in our school .
We were there alone , my friend with his broken leg and myself .
They are able to give and receive information very quickly .
In this book , Heathcliff , as a child , did n't have a bad character ; but his situation caused him to live with the Earnshaw family , where the grownup made him rude , aggressive , and noisy .
The shopping center is right opposite of the hotel ; therefore , some people may want to just wait at the hotel and have a cup of coffee .
I hope you will consider my suggestion .
You do not have to waste money at all .
I must sign off as I want to catch the post .
That means , for example , while you are sitting in the office you are able to control your home with the computer .
In my opinion , math , politics , Chinese , English , and painting lessons are the most interesting ones .
So I will be very happy to improve my art at camp .
I have good singing skills too .
I SUGGEST THAT WE GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING , AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE , WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW .
First of all , I think that famous people deserve to have private lives .
We will be more understanding with others .
I 'm writing this letter to you because , during my stay in London , I went to the theater to see a musical , and I had a very disappointing evening .
How is about an accommodation .
As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song , I saw a number of famous musicians nearby .
From the beginning of the century to now , modern technology has changed and made our daily lives easier .
They are always expected to be beautiful , intelligent , and good-looking .
I was very excited when I could see a star !
Therefore , I read " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie . "
Believe me , shopping can also be painful .
So staying in a log cabin will probably help me avoid a lot of problems .
In your previous letter , you asked for information about interesting buildings to visit in my country .
The school works together with known companies of the branch like Marriott hotels , Air France , Princess Cruises , among others in order to provide students with highly qualified training .
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders , I knew I had to see it .
They ca n't communicate with ordinary children and attend ordinary schools .
I would like to travel in July because I am a student ; therefore , I only have time off during this part of the year .
The ticket for the show is included .
I 'm writing to you because I want you to give us the money back for your " London 's Newest and Best Musical Show : Over the Rainbow , " presented at the Circle Theatre .
When I received your letter with photographs of that flat , it really looked nice .
Another thing is that there was no discount available , so we spent a lot of money on a very bad show .
The building is upgraded every year .
I have also been told that they were going to make a music video from that concert , so I tried as best as I could .
In addition to that , realistic stories are more attractive ; I personally do n't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents , as I know they can not be true .
I am excited and looking forward to doing camp there .
I am very delighted to visit the two weeks Camp California in the U.S.A. .
But I think I will choose basketball and photography because basketball is the only sport I can play well .
Moreover , students are allowed to be admitted for free .
As far as I am concerned , I would prefer an accommodation in a log cabin , but in case there are no cabins left , I can stay in a tent as well .
I made two albums about birds and flowers .
I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything .
I think that it will be nice for the end-of-conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give the students time to enjoy themselves and to dance .
Thank you for asking me about my taste and being concerned about it .
I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved , bad-tempered , and angry with the world for interfering in their lives .
I 'd like to change a rule at home .
I wanted to say thank you that I was the lucky person who won that competition .
After the show , I decided to have dinner in your theater restaurant , but I could n't because it closed .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer to sleep in the tents because I never been in one , and it is a lot more fun than log cabins .
Is n't " reading the gossips " what any one of us love doing ?
This story happened a long time ago .
I hope my recommendations will help you in the choice of a building to visit .
But when I went there , it was closed .
Last month , I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
I have taken a photography course and I enjoy taking photos of animals .
Some say it is math , which is practical and useful . The majority say it is boring , unless you choose a job which uses all your math knowledge , such as accounting . Otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer .
AT 20 : 00 , we stopped in a coffee house to eat . They shouted , " At 20 : 30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave . "
I am looking forward to staying in contact with you .
I AM WRITING TO YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU .
I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July .
However , journalists should think about not only commercial value but also morality and principles of concern .
As a result , journalists should respect their life and always write real news .
I went to the theater last weekend to see " Over the Rainbow . "
I have something really exciting to share with you .
I will start an Italian course in August , so it will be impossible for me to leave .
The show has begun later , much later than your advertisement writes , at about 20 : 15 . The show started 45 minutes later .
By the way , I 'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should prepare and how much money I should bring with me .
They just said , " We do n't give money back . "
Otherwise , if you are in a good mood , it will turn into a bad mood .
It 's a great opportunity because in our fast developing world , we have to look fashionable and this kind of show happens quite rarely .
Technology is the thing that makes our lives easy .
I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on April 5 is suitable for you .
But we had to wear the uniform , and we had to study a lot to pass the exams .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me about the two weeks at Camp California that I won .
Thanks a lot for your letter .
Moreover , I practiced many aspects of my specialty ; for me , it was the most important real experience .
Technology is essential to our life ; we need it each minute and each second .
Regarding your questions , the following are my answers .
The star had been changed ; the show had started only at 20 : 15 ; and there were no discounts available .
So you will enjoy traditional foods , music , dances , and games from all over the world .
According to the advertisement , Danny Brook would be starring , but it was a different actor .
A survey has been done , and the issue is which subjects ( lessons ) and activities the students think are the most enjoyable .
Well , I tried to do so , but the lady at the desk told me that there were quotas available at that price but were already sold out !
Military technology has affected our lives more than we think , because most of the equipment we use was originally created by those people .
I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars .
When the important day is coming , it tells me .
Paul was wondering whether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words " I am glad to meet you , Paul . "
From one side , these people chose to become public people .
I would like to travel in July , because it is the summer , and the weather is sunny ; moreover , I am totally free during this month .
Besides , we would like to go to the London Fashion And Leisure Show , which was advertised in the newspaper " Metro " yesterday .
I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying clothes .
It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the break . The smokers in the school yard , the buffet , and the other pupils , who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework .
Unfortunately , I will be able to go only in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for these dates .
I think it would be better for me to travel in July .
I love swimming , and also I 've got a scuba diving license .
Technology nowadays is something everybody has on their mind .
Do you have any rules at school that make you upset ?
My family loves him and supports us .
And it has free entrance for students .
Maybe children will not have to go to school ; they just will stay in their rooms and study from a computer , like some kind of on-line education .
Secondly , it was supposed to start at 19 : 30 but actually started at 20 : 15 . Forty-five minutes later !
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future .
We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people .
Finally , I appreciate your organization and look forward to hearing from you at the next International Arts Festival .
All the students in my class are excited about one more thing .
It was n't a normal fish . It was Gold Fish and asked him as a human , " Please , let me go , and I can do for you anything you want . "
You have to read it yourself . And if your cousin likes crime stories , it is a perfect book !
However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March .
When I stay home , I can watch television or listen to the radio etc .
As I explained , it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have , and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before .
After the play , which turned out to be just as bad as I thought , I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant , but it was closed , and for no reason !
Even though I worked hard on it , I was very surprised at winning the first prize .
Almost everything is connected to computers , for example , education , researching the universe , and others .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
Moreover , the play did not start at the time it was supposed to .
The reason for choosing these two activities is that they contrast themselves ; I want one more exciting , that asks for more agility , and another more calm and relaxing , that asks only for my ability to paint .
We would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hear from you soon .
It is sometimes a real fight , who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician .
About two weeks ago , I went to London for a week 's week-long vacation .
Also they are showing their first play on the 2nd of July .
New technologies and facilities wo n't improve the relationship between people .
Realistic stories , thus , develop our imagination and creativity , which are essential in our lives .
It 's one of the most important things for me , to have a chance to forget about my present , luxurious life and try doing something different .
Another aspect is that children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention .
To begin with , in your letter you asked me when I would like to travel .
I am certain you will think over that particular visit to the " London Fashion and Leisure Show , " on behalf of all the students .
I want to play tennis and swim .
MY NAME IS JAMES RAMIREZ , AND I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday .
As I did n't expect to be successful , I am very happy with this result .
" What will clothes be like 100 years from now ? "
Each of us had a different task .
I think that it will have a similar structure but will include some new technological advantages , like having the whole house controlled by a computer so that , for example , we can turn on the lights in the bedroom just by pressing a button while we are watching TV sitting on the sofa .
What do you think about this plan ?
On the last day , I go to your house and then we think about our conference plan. .
Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .
I prefer to live in tents because I feel very natural .
On the other hand , if you think that you 'll be in the red , you 'd better stay at home .
People backstage , including me , were helping to clean up all the stuff and get ready for the end of the concert .
Mathematics teachers do a great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons .
Finally , I 'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience in my life .
It was not our fault that we went in after 11 pm .
I am really happy to receive the letter about Camp California from you .
We could n't imagine our life without them .
I realized that it was a different actor playing instead of Danny Brook .
There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets , which appeared to be wrong too .
From the beginning , it was all a disappointment .
Most of them are flats which have at least 20 floors .
I 'm not quite a young man , and during the past several years of my life I have become accustomed to some more comfort .
After a while , she pulled herself together and paused for a minute .
But on the other hand , I have never done surfing . I am a complete beginner but I am dying to do it .
Fashion of the Future .
At the ticket office , I also asked for a discount , but they told me this was n't possible , Instead , your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available !
I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included .
I would like to ask if you could expand the plays and films more for next year ?
After the show , we went to the theater restaurant , but it was closed .
It made it possible not only to discover and to talk with new people on the Internet but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parent .
I have n't a clue about it .
I was thinking , " What should I do ? "
When I must buy something , I usually ca n't find it , and then shopping becomes a nightmare .
Finally , I would like to inquire about how much money I should take with me and also what kind of clothes would be most suitable to wear .
So I am very grateful to the man who invented it ; unfortunately , I have forgotten his name .
Finally , I would like to ask you which kinds of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp , the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me , and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
The saleswomen are too busy and do n't have a moment to give you service .
It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight .
I do n't know why , and I 'd like you to tell me the reason .
We spent 2 weeks with the family .
They wanted to be famous and knew the price before .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert I enjoyed helping at last month ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I 'm going to help them again .
Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing , because I used to be an assistant at a Korean national pool , so I am good at swimming .
In my opinion , shopping is just to cover our basic needs .
Every day , like everybody else , I watch TV , see international news , hear the radio , play games on my computer , or come across American or Asian people without going outside my house .
I am one of your husband 's students .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Firstly , I helped selling the tickets .
What is impressive about this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
Finally , could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes , towels , and extra money ?
It 's a good chance for you to improve your English .
Clothes are part of each culture and one of the things which expresses our taste and personality .
It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment .
Regarding the end-of-conference party , I would suggest wearing a dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man , though it is not formal .
We have organized to do the party from three to six o'clock in the afternoon in the College Canteen . For food , we organized a buffet , but could you also help us with the music ? What does he prefer , if he has a special preference ?
I helped at a pop concert of an up-and-coming group , and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
I would also take an outdoor lesson " training . "
You had to start the show at 19 : 30 p.m. , but you started too late , at 20 : 15 p.m. , without any explanation to people .
On my first day , I did n't work .
Styles mix ; colors and shapes come back from the past ; only the fabrics are different .
A friend of mine gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place .
Unfortunately , the musical show was annoying .
Last but not least , I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America .
The queue is not the only problem . If you go by car , there is a parking problem , if you go by bus there is a queue again , and you have to carry many carrier bags during your journey and you wo n't always be lucky to find a seat to sit .
But I 'm really happy that I had even a small role in making people enjoy themselves .
I wish you would have informed us before .
The other one is the television .
As mentioned above , please take care to give me more information , and if you 'd like to know more , please call me for further discussion .
We often go out to sing in the karaoke bar .
I am glad that all the accommodation and travel costs have been paid for .
Firstly , what kind of clothes do I have to bring to the camp , clothes for hot or cold weather ?
I am not really satisfied with it .
First , what clothes should I bring ?
I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you are in New York on vacation .
Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not , and overall , it is not always enjoyable .
I did not get a discount .
I know you have good taste in presents !!!!
It said that it would start at 19 : 30 but it did not .
The group has been booked for the Palace Hotel , which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held .
I am very interested in going for two weeks to Camp California in the USA .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there are people only from six countries .
I am looking forward to traveling .
I am writing because my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Besides , the theater restaurant had closed down before I got out of the show .
Technology , are we prepared for these advances ?
However , we have seen an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
A crowded hall is not good for enjoying music .
I have sung in the church 's choir for three years , and I have had singing classes at school since first grade .
50 years ago , Korean mothers would have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food .
So , I have some opinions on this , which I would like to tell .
Anyway , we still want to go to the Science Museum and shopping as well , but we think we can go shopping on the last afternoon of our trip .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The festival was very well organized with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows .
Thank you very much for your letter . I was glad to get it and find out a lot of news about you .
I would appreciate it if you could supply some towels , if possible .
I would prefer surfing or climbing , but I have to think about my health .
I was very surprised when I saw that singers are n't as sophisticated and self-confident as they are written about in the newspapers .
What do we use every day for many hours , sometimes from early in the morning until late in the evening ?
I think if we wear these clothes , we will travel everywhere easier than we use cars , ships , planes , and spaceships .
In the future , it will be able to help people even more , since it has been increasing its capacity day after day .
To sum up , I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent , reasonably-priced tickets like this year 's .
The other bad point was the time when the show started , it was already 8 : 15 when the first star entered the scene , but your advertisement said 7 : 30 !
People use the telephone also for their personal lives , for example , when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has been considerably changed by rapidly developing modern technology .
I received your letter this morning and was very surprised by it .
You can not only listen to her best detective stories but also learn English automatically .
The only problem is that on April 4 , I have my graduation .
Modern technology has changed my daily life , from physical activity to mental activity ( ?.
But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing , for example bread , on Friday evening and on weekdays , each supermarket is crowded .
The activities are quite hard to choose , really , because you have a lot of choices I like .
Finally , I would like to ask you for some further information about the clothes and the money we will need .
Another problem is I realized that discounts were available . However , there was n't any discount .
She is very intelligent .
What we all did was make many cups of coffee and help to find their missing socks or any other clothing .
We can love them without disturbing too .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Instead of going shopping , we could go to the show .
Besides all those improvements and comforts , I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us .
In every country there are the famous people who are in the middle of the public attention .
In addition to this , it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us , because for students it is completely free .
In conclusion , I think that people who are too interested in other people 's lives , do not have an interesting life and are unhappy !
First of all , could you let us know if the date of June 16th is all right with his timetable program ?
What do you think of going to visit the Arts Museum ?
In 1874 Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city ( a small town near Savannah ) .
I learned to paint when I was a student .
In conclusion , I wanted to say thanks for such a special weekend .
Its first application was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with only that reasonably priced ticket we paid for for the whole weekend .
When I was a child , I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked , but it was nearly impossible to have them .
So when I read about other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught , I got very angry and annoyed .
On the other hand , I would like to point out that the festival would be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made .
This is an experience I 'll never forget .
Besides all of that , at the end of the musical , I went to the your Theatre Restaurant , to eat dinner , because I had left home without eating , and so I was hungry at that time .
It closed at 10 pm , but the show finished at 10 : 30 pm .
First of all , I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook , but sadly he was n't there ; he was filled in for by a different actor , who was instead rather disappointing .
We often rushed while we lived here , but there was a lot of fun too .
If I want to buy a nice pair of shoes , I have to go into a city center and browse around , from shop to shop , until I find the shoes I like .
However , I have never tried to go surfing .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
If the door breaks , we can replace it quickly , and it wo n't be expensive , since it 's plastic .
Well , I suppose that almost everything in the future house will be automatic and will obey what people say .
I always had my own key and unlocked the door by myself .
As for me , the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer .
I am writing to tell you about my experience in last month 's pop concert , where I was helping my friend Nick , who was the bouncer of the place .
Suddenly a murder happens !
I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions !
In your advertisement , you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Moreover , once I was going to pay for the tickets , I found another thing : there were no discounts available .
When I needed some information , I had to go to the library to find it in books or newspapers .
I am looking forward to your reply .
Without a doubt , discovering the computer has been the most important technological event .
Or without leaving the office , you are able to heat the water for a hot bath .
I was so disappointed .
I am writing to you to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival .
BUT IT WASN'T THE WORST , BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES THAT CAN PLAY ON THE THEATER .
Your advertisement says " discounts available , " but they was not available .
I am able to meet my friends quickly on the Internet by just clicking the mouse .
Maybe it is right to say in a flat instead of a building .
Last May , I had a week 's vacation in London , and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for " OVER THE RAINBOW , " the MUSICAL SHOW .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
They are famous , but I think they need to be alone sometimes .
It looked at me and spoke .
The college director has suggested wearing smart clothes for the occasion , and I would recommend the same .
They also took me to an afterparty and they asked me if I would like to do this again .
I prefer to stay in log cabins ; therefore , I 'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog .
I would rather type some coursework up than handwrite it .
Firstly , I found that there were no discounts as it was announced in the advertisement .
It 's like a joke but a bit scary .
I let this pass , and I bought it anyway , thinking that possibly it was only a mistake in your advertisement .
If it is possible , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollen .
Recently , I visited an arts festival , organized with your help .
Are they provided , or can we find some places to buy them ?
Then I 'd like to join the activities of swimming and singing .
Finally , I helped them ; in return , I had a good experience as well as enjoyed listening to music .
There was no doubt she would never , ever look at me again .
We have to think about it this way .
Where 's the fun in that ?
I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances .
During break time , I did give lots of directions to people who could n't find the restrooms and information , such as where they could get a cup of coffee .
The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer .
If not , you can go on Saturday but badly , there are too many costumers . You ca n't walk or try on clothes and it 's very hot .
It was really great .
I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and I look forward to meeting you at this conference .
The show finished late .
I look forward to seeing you .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
Probably , because their parents have n't enough time to go outside the city and show them nature .
The Barbican Centre was built in 1975 . Apart from banks and important offices , there are also the world stock market exchange , an opera theater , shopping arcades , books , and records stores .
I am now writing this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure .
These things provide me complete convenience .
I have been given much information on the international student conference .
So in fact , people 's homes will become more convenient and comfortable .
Finally , could you tell me how far the nearest town or village is ?
Is it hot enough ?
On top of this , we intended to go to the theater restaurant , which was closed because of building activities .
Lastly , it could be nice for students who are interested in arts if you held special events , for instance , a song contest , a writing competition , or dance lessons .
I had even planned something else to do , but I agreed because she 's a very good friend .
From any point of view , the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today .
First , I 'll tell you the name of the hotel ; it 's the Palace Hotel .
It has been so long since I wrote to you the last time ...
Anyway , I 'll tell you about my wonderful experience , which I enjoyed at a pop concert .
Nowadays it 's getting obvious that designers sell only details , but significant changes do n't show up .
This event was not what I call " a perfect evening out , " as your advertisement promised .
The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting everyone with BB guns .
The biggest disadvantage is pollution .
In addition to this , the show did not start on time , 19 : 30 , so I had to wait for 45 minutes .
The designer will have a lot of ideas for how to make very nice and useful clothes .
To begin with , the actor you publicized was going to perform did n't .
I think it was the water .
I am really looking forward to taking part in Camp California .
The machine that was used to read this card was so big , you needed a whole room to fit the computer .
The end-of-conference party is designed to give a rough idea about many different cultures .
There we will have the chance to be made up or to try new hairstyles too .
Because the London Fashion program takes place on Tuesday , I would suggest changing your plan .
I immediately said " yes , " as did my friend .
I understood you wanted to know when am I available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed , so I ran to my brother to explain to him what I had seen .
She will come to Liverpool next week , and I 'll put her up .
I am writing to complain about a musical show I went to one week ago .
It contains a wide range of activities , for example , sightseeing , a river trip , visiting the science museum and gallery , and shopping .
I feel entitled to compensation for this event .
Thank you for organizing the trip to London .
Secondly , could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin , because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than living in tents ?
The most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE .
If you do , please tell me .
Pat told him that I was in love with him .
Perhaps , there will be personal computers , which will control everything : every item of furniture , light , and temperature .
It was unbelievable and tiring as well .
Last but not least important is the class called " know-how , " which shows students how to cope with unexpected problems even if they are under stress .
I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring .
I am writing to give information on a very interesting building to visit .
I hope I 'll be able to travel in July since my children have summer vacation beginning in in July .
I hope we attend the next pop concert together as a staff and enjoy our time !
So you see my point .
I hope this is n't offending you too much ...
Thank you very much for many interesting spots on this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are sure , will be very exciting .
I know that they are not like us .
In general , the rules at private schools are much stricter than the ones at state schools .
All the trash , dust , dirty dishes , plates , and cups will be washed and cleaned automatically .
" You see , I am a mere product of your mind , but I would like to go out of the Heavy Sleep .
The restaurant should have been opened when I came out , but it was closed because of the hour the show finished .
I am just coming back from a week 's holiday in London , which has been , all in all , really nice .
Let me know if you are going to come so that I can prepare the bedroom to put you up .
In addition , we are fascinated with by their marriage , children , vacations , etc .
The people who were there to watch the show were very angry , and they were shouting because they had been waiting for too long . And I absolutely agree with them .
You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have , buying clothes , jewelry , furniture , etc .
But the positive way new technology has changed my life is in the means of communication .
Firstly , I hoped to have a relaxing night of entertainment with your musical show , but it was not the case .
I 'm waiting for your reply .
I would also like to know some more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which will be necessary for me to bring .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had had .
You should review the advertisements you do because you give wrong information .
However , we saw an advertisement , and we are keen on the idea of going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Her boyfriend , Guy Richie , was there too , and he 's a really good person .
I preferred to come at 19 : 30 because it is better at night , and it would n't finish late ; but the theater started at 20 : 15 , and we got bored waiting to start .
Communications move the world , and famous people use them to improve their work : politicians for their campaigns , and film stars to make their latest movie famous .
It does n't matter that people have started worrying more about pollution in the world .
A couple of weeks later , my sister called me while I was at work ; completely devastated and weeping scalding tears , she could hardly pronounce a word .
To get from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no . 7 and get off at St . James College , where the conference will take place .
Anyway , what you wanted to know was what has my job been .
We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place during our visit to London on the 14th of March .
And it 's not ending ; I hope that , in my thirties , I 'll go to Mars on vacation ...
At the end of the summer , we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia .
This is a precise letter that I write to you now .
There are some things I would like to ask : the type ( and quantity ) of clothes I will have to take , if it is necessary to take some money , and any additional stuff ( like raincoats ) .
Everything is easy now .
So I would be grateful if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
Another important thing is that , despite the number and quality of films , there were , from my point of view , not many plays .
My job was very easy : I had to help Sting in everything . For example , if he wanted water , I had to give him water , and it was marvelous .
Thank you for your answer .
But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt whether to use it or not . Especially now , when " big-mouth " Pat has spread the news to literally everyone .
In this domain , you have to afford everyday to the development of new technology .
When the play " Over the Rainbow " finished , I tried to eat something , but the fact was that the theater restaurant was closed , because your personnel were cleaning all the mess that an old dog had done .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work . My current post finishes at the end of June , but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
First of all , I recommend you go on the 8 a.m. boat .
In my opinion , technology has made human life easier , funnier , and more comfortable .
Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
She 'll probably come with a friend ; if you want , you can join us .
Technology allows us to have more time for distractions or for other things we really like to do .
A home made out of plastic , with plastic windows , so we can have our home for a long time .
He / she can just press the button or send an e-mail to operate what he / she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .
I am writing to express my disappointment with the play " Over the Rainbow , " which is being performed at the Circle Theatre .
It was n't very pleasant .
Then I can prepare suitable clothes for that weather .
So I wanted to know if there will be more films next year .
Every person in the world looks for technology every day to improve the way they live their own life .
It felt good to remember and remind ourselves to speak in a correct way .
But sometimes I ask myself if the " ancient world , " without science , technological discoveries , and industries , was more authentic than ours .
Concerning singing activities , I think I 'm quite good , as I have been in my school 's choir for 3 years .
I said " yes , " and I am sure it was the best decision of my life .
I especially like watercolor painting .
I appreciate these shops for having lots of products , cheap prices , and big spaces .
It is also expensive , and I ca n't afford to stay there too long .
Here is the information which you asked me for .
It also changed my free time ; they have invented great games like PlayStation , and you can have a really good time with your friend playing .
Actually , they came from only six countries .
And I really was disappointed by the different actor 's performance .
This way , we could obtain selective places at NASA University .
All of them were shocked by what they heard . In addition to this , they started to talk about it everywhere .
It is a good start to go on a sightseeing bus on Monday morning . We can see all the famous buildings in a few hours .
Personally , I do n't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops , so I buy all that I can using on-line services .
Finally , it was a very nice day with a great experience .
I think that if we mix lessons with sport activities , the combination will give us complete success .
I 'm sure we will find another solution .
I do n't like tinking , my house of my life , without all this facilities . In winter , when it gets dark very early , and after , I need to spend my free time at home .
One story is about ten people who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
However , I go far away from my family and other people and have virtual relationships .
I hope you will enjoy it .
I helped set up the sound equipment , program the light system on the computer , and tidy up Madonna 's room !
We prepared some special attractions , like live dance music and hot or cold buffets .
I was very surprised with the result of the competition .
He actually went to Carla and told her everything .
As you can see , most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided .
I 'm very happy and lazy at the same time .
For example , the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor , but he was not .
This could save lives !
Although I wish that my accommodation at Camp California be in tents , I had that experience last summer .
I would like to ask you for my money back .
I think , it was very clever of me to record that moment which I will never ever forget , and that was the thing that I most liked of that experience .
Based on everything listed above , I would like to receive £10 , which I have paid , back .
Unfortunately , it could be inconvenient for me because of pollution from cars and factories .
Furthermore , the show started at the wrong time .
During it , everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers of the conference .
It changes every day and I do not know if we will be able to understand it .
Then , by some " strange power , " my left foot was moving , and I wanted to stop it , but it was too difficult .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT. 10 MINUTES AFTER I WAS FOLLOWING HIM , I START BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH THE PLACE , AND I WAS FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE .
After waiting a while in this uncomfortable place , the show started . I waited 45 minutes , and then the actors appeared , but I found out that the main one was n't Danny Brook ; it was an impostor .
We know what you have done and your dog will be sold . "
However , I must say , it was quite the opposite .
Who of you could imagine life without the telephone - not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment - not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
Well , that would be all .
The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event .
Last month , I helped at a pop concert , and it was marvelous .
Fortunately , the people from my class are really great , and we all love trips - especially interesting ones .
It is very useful .
To make the matter worse , I had expected to get the ticket with some discount , but when I went to the ticket office , there was not any discount available .
By choosing this lifestyle , they should have realized what their life would look like .
I did n't get involved that much in writing a script because it was very hard , and the director wrote most of it , but the main idea of the stage background was mine , and I am very proud of it .
Is there only one teacher for each sport ? And how many are we in each group of activities ?
" Yes , Oh Lord , he did it because we beat his team at football , " Nick said .
I am very good at playing basketball .
First of all , I will be able to travel in July because I have not finished school .
Also in the advertisement , you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't , and also that people could visit the theater restaurant after the show to eat something or to have a drink .
In conclusion , if you go shopping reasonably , have a good time .
There are many sources of light in this world , such as sunlight , moonlight , and candlelight .
Now then , this advertising was completely different . I am really disappointed with your musical . I am asking you for my money back , because I did n't enjoy your musical .
Modern technology has changed my daily life in many aspects .
I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends .
I go to the swimming pool two times a week , so I am good at this sport .
When I was younger , I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project , I would take a lot of time researching at libraries , looking for old books .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
From my point of view , people 's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine , TV , cooker , and light , connecting to the owner .
So they can be just ordinary people like us .
When you work in an office , a factory , or a society , you have the same schedule as them . So , you can only go shopping during your lunch break .
My name is John and I have been in the latest International Arts Festival .
As I told you in my last letter , I worked two weeks ago in Edinburgh helping at a pop concert .
I went to the " International Arts Festival " on November 21-22 .
I was really excited by the idea of seeing that show .
I am willing to show you the autograph and the photograph .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I 've never been to California ; therefore , please let me know about the weather there .
The shopping is great when you have lots of money and time ; you can buy clothes , shoes , makeup , CDs , whatever .
Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed until 20 : 15 .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definitely need one . It also holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistics on your computer for doing social research and some analysis .
Please send me a list of the items I many need there , including the most appropriate clothes for American weather .
I was terribly disappointed .
Celular phones can be inconvenient sometimes , but it can be very useful in certain situations : when your car is broken down on the road , when you need to be found anywhere and at any time ( if you are a doctor , a lawyer , or a journalist , for instance ) , and so forth .
To make things even worse , the play did n't start at 19 : 30 as it was supposed to , but instead it started 45 minutes late , at 20 : 15 , and your famous discounts were n't even available .
I choose singing because I love singing , and I have been in a choir for 7 years now .
I am writing in response to it .
At the camp , I would like to choose two activities : painting and singing . I love painting ; in university I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint because I work in a bank and have a baby .
I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday , March 14 from 10 : 00 - 19 : 00 .
In addition to this , the stories are going to be read in English .
I am writing to provide you with the information you require .
About the activities while at the camp , I would like to enjoy swimming , not because I am good at it , just because I like it . The other one is photography .
So try to imagine my situation . I had paid a lot of money , and I could n't see a good show ; I am really disappointed .
There is one thing I would like to ask you . It 's about how much money I will need to go out at night , to spend on food , and these kinds of things .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing .
I 'm writing to express my feelings and opinions about the International Arts Festival which was held a few days ago .
I am writing to complain about the musical I saw last Friday in your theater .
Also , you can spend hours trying to decide between wonderful blue trousers or a beautiful black dress , for example .
It depends on every individual to change their mind and act as a " smart " shopper .
It starts already in the morning when we wake up by the sound of an alarm clock .
Finally , my parents are all the time arguing about different solutions to my problem , and this all thanks to Pat .
I am writing to complain about your musical show .
Maybe you will spend all your money on a new thing , and a few hours later , your best friend will invite you to go to the nightclub , but you are short of money .
I think I would prefer climbing and painting .
I have to choose painting and photography , therefore .
Should I bring my camera , warm clothes , or any pocket money ?
I could be interested in your letter .
The pop group was all young people ( between 23 - 30 years old ) , and all of them were really nice .
During the day , I speak with the majority of my colleagues by phone or e-mail .
I 'm writing you following our visit to your theater last night .
One day while all their friends were there talking , Pat told everyone that Pandora had committed a robbery .
Thank you very much for your letter .
But also , here are some notes on what you should improve in the next year 's festival to make it absolutely wonderful .
By the way , I 've understood I had better trust nobody .
How much money do I bring ?
First off , all I would like to say is that it has started later than it should have . I had to wait for about forty-five minutes .
We have to face it - there are two sides .
I think also housewives will receive more help with a robot in the household .
Between male and female will be not important for clothes in 100 years time .
I had to wait all that time in the street , because the hall was not big enough .
You asked me about my experiences .
What more do you want ?
Your dance shows are very beautiful . The art exhibitions are something original and exciting .
I am very glad that I have won first prize in your competition and that I can go to the United States .
The restaurant should have stayed open until the show finished .
If you have more questions about the conference or something else , do not hesitate to ask me .
Although the jazz , rock , and classical music was great , some concerts and halls are too small . Could you consider making them bigger next year .
For my accommodation , I would prefer a tent , as I love nature and like going camping a lot .
Also , what is the weather like ?
Lastly , the restaurant which was going to be opened was , in fact , closed without a reason !
I 'm writing to you regarding the radio program next Saturday where " The Old Man and the Sea , " by Earnest Hemingway , will be read .
My daily life should be changed by these innovations !
The organizer of the concert asked my school for about 15 people who did do art to help decorate the stage .
I CAN NOT EXPRESS HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PRIZE .
One of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes ; our school is now the best in the country in all ages . We are impressed with this , and we can show what we do in order to be the best .
But she did , and she asked me out .
People have seen in the last 10 years how different our clothes have become .
For the activities , I would like to choose tennis , which I am not too bad at , and climbing , which I have never done , but am interested in .
And of course , the furniture in people 's homes will not change either .
After the show , we went immediately to the ticket office to ask for money back , but they were too strict and close-minded .
It was a big mistake to have given her a secret , especially an important one .
With the help of some modern technology , our daily life would not be so difficult .
It always happens with people , does n't it ?
We imagine that would be the best vacation of our lives .
They started charging down the field towards the fire , and once in range , everyone threw their balloon as far as they could .
Moreover , there were not any discounts and all of the tickets had the same prizes .
I sometimes want to hear their voice on the telephone .
The reason for this is global warming , which is the solution for the problem and another reason why this idea is possible .
I helped with the ticket sales , with security , and with design ...
In addition , the resort has an interesting historical background about architecture and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico . For example , it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico .
On the other hand , during my stay in Camp California , I want to go swimming because I practice this activity regularly and I often do competitions . This is one of my hobbies .
It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp .
I really look forward to receiving your reply soon .
Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone .
In my opinion , there should be a rule which lets the media approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home , to leave them at least one place to feel safe .
To sum up , it is a big school where you have a lot of interesting lessons and some optional activities to do in your free time .
First of all , we are happy to have won the first prize in your competition .
I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan .
Choosing gives me such deep pleasure because I never have to worry about where I get money for my wishes .
Eventually , I would like to ask you about money and clothes .
Firstly I would like to travel in July only because I have two months of vacation , which are July and August . I choose July because it is the only one month that I think I 'm free .
Firstly , it is a good idea that the festival is international .
Do you know " Radio Head " ?
Moreover , they will be able to create a special climate for each room .
Another point is the time when it started , exactly 45 minutes later .
About the accommodation at Camp California , I would like to stay in a tent .
As you look around among , everybody has a car or motorcycle .
I hope you will understand my disappointment and the reasons why I ask for my money back .
But , on the other hand , people will still have to program them , as they have to do nowadays .
I was wondering which kind of clothes we need and about money and meals .
Finally , we should film the lunch , which is also a moment to relax for the students and for the teachers . We should n't forget to film the teacher room because if a school is made of students , it 's also made of teachers .
The tickets were a little expensive but I was with another TEN people , so when we read " Discounts Available " we expected that the theater had organized a special discount for group of numerous people .
The two activities I have chosen are basketball and tennis .
So , what are we going to do ?
If only I could sing beautifully !
However , you changed actors without informing viewers .
In addition , I would like to talk about the success among most visitors of the weekend ticket , due to its economical price and because of its comfort of use .
First of all , I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment .
I 'm looking forward hearing from you .
When the band had just started to play , lots of girls started to jump the fence , getting very close to them . Some of the girls started to take their clothes off , which was the best part for me , but some of the security guards went there and took them away .
It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy ; shops are full of every kind of thing .
Secondly , there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small .
We have seen your program and like all of those , especially the Science Museum ; it will good for us to increase our knowledge , and so on .
In the future both of them will be getting closer and closer .
Last , I have no experience abroad . Therefore , I 'd like to know about the weather in California during July .
To conclude , in this short video , we must show that , thanks to our school , we are able to make the best of ourselves come out .
Both of them are my favorite sports , and I 'm quite good .
Do you know that this concert will be on television ?
It was a very good program , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class would enjoy .
I am very happy to know I won the prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A .
When the show started , the person who was acting was not Danny Brook , and he did not seem to be an actor .
It is well known in almost all families , often with a lot of different channels .
Hey , listen guys , we will take his dog , which he loves very much , and we will sell it to Sally who wants one .
Firstly , I was designated to sell the tickets .
After that , a being climbed out from the potato .
Her family was very rich and a lot of men wanted to marry to her .
But there 's something that I 'd like to ask .
It will take place on Tuesday , March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall from 10 : 00 to 19 : 00 .
As you know , I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents ' house , but that Sunday , I was driving when suddenly I saw in the lay-by one excellent car . It was a Jaguar with Will Smith on it , I stopped and asked if he needed some help and he said " of course . "
My name is Sandre Atos , and I am writing to you because this last weekend I went to the theater you manage , to see what was called " London 's newest and best musical show . "
Nowadays we have Dri-FIT kind of clothes that keep the temperature of our body and clothes that do n't get wet or even dirty .
He fought in the Spanish Civil War and in World War II , always on the search for answers to questions like " ... what defines a man , " or " ... what happens to us in critical situations " .
To sum up , the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group .
So as you can see , it was not a so perfect evening for me as I thought .
It is my favorite group .
I received your letter last Monday .
However , it was closed for cleaning .
Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money , usually much more than we expect .
I am finishing my studies in June ; then I have a month off ( July ) , and on August 1st I am starting a new job .
It 's brilliant , is n't it ?
This is important for everybody , and I think this is important for them too .
They said that it was n't necessary , and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenery was being prepared for the concert .
Thank you for choosing our ticket at the final .
Her daughter , Lourdes Maria , is such a pretty little girl that I could n't take my eyes off of her .
I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year .
Now I am 16 , and I have got a nice baby boy .
It seems incredible , but they 're common habits for us .
Actually , it was terrible and I would like to have my money back .
How 's your new flat ?
This is very stressful .
After that , I prepared the group .
I would like to thank you for first prize .
Most of all , I 'm so happy that I could choose some activities .
And as new discoveries bring more discoveries , progress is going faster and faster .
