It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
First of all you , said that the star would be Danny Brook , but it was not .
I think it 's a great opportunity because we will have a chance to see the latest fashion , leisure and sportswear , as well the way to do the perfect makeup and hairstyle .
But to solve this problem , we may think first about its origin ...
The computer was invented 30 years or more ago and started processing information with a big card that was perforated and made a small hole , and each hole meant something like a code .
The first point is that we will use , more often , new technologies like telecommunications or the internet .
If people want to enjoy shopping , we must consider before buying something - do I really want it ?
As a teenager I must admit that there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping .
I think if you have lots of money and do n't know what to do with it , do not go shopping . Give the money to charity . That is better than shopping .
You can choose the price most suitable for you .
As modern technology is changing the world rapidly , I think we are all involved in the revolution it 's causing .
Also the ticket discounts were not available .
I hope you will find interest in my letter and I look forward to seeing you .
That was not what your advertisement had shown .
Food and beverages will be available .
I hope that my advice will help you .
Thank you for your attention .
After working 30 minutes , a singer appeared .
Firstly , despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring , another actor was starring in the actual show and his performance was literally horrible , and disappointing .
Another point is that with the help of the technology we can communicate with the whole world .
We always want to know about others ' lives , especially the famous ones , and even the ones that we hate .
Now , I have two questions about camping .
The best thing was that I spoke in English , because I was forgetting it , and that I met my favorite singer .
Well , I would only be available in July , because at that time I would be on winter vacation .
I am looking forward to the meeting with you and to our mutual work during the conference .
Anyone can get to the city center with the No.456 bus and then on foot to the castle .
One night , I heard a strange sound .
It all comes from my parents .
But this problem is solved by itself .
Thank you for everything .
The next morning as Pat was going to school , he met Bad Jon and told him , " Hey , you .
The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous .
We thought that we could change the program this way : we could go to the Science Museum Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
You certainly saw that plays and films had a lot of success .
So , she asked me to fill her position .
Shopping is when humans go to the shop and buy what they went . However , I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes , and all sort of things .
In the past , everything was very different .
I have just two questions .
The aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resort building which was built 10 years ago and is one of the first buildings that was built with the latest technology and made by an important Mexican architect .
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
You also asked me about two activities .
I also wanted to know if I have to bring some money to buy souvenirs and food or will that be paid for me , too ?
Lastly , I have questions about clothes and money .
I 'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize .
Thank you very much .
Secondly , if you happen to forget something , you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers , and that can take up even more time .
Some time before , I did not know about the internet .
How has modern technology changed our daily life ?
That is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice .
Instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , we had mean actors .
Of course , if everyone pays less attention or interest , the situations should be better .
It was absolutely fantastic .
I am writing to you as the representative of our class in your college .
The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines , so , today 's children must be introduced to computers from an early age , so that they could have a chance to compete with the furious emergence in the future .
When I saw your advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have as perfect an evening as you have written in your advertisement .
In addition , it would be nice if you could send me an address where I am going to stay , so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family .
The entrance is free for students .
I also would like to talk about your concerts .
I ca n't go to the town center of a big city .
Finally , I must choose traveling there in July because I am not allowed to take vacations in other months due to my work .
I 'm really happy to hear from you !
Actually I 've only done light and sound in drama day at my school at the end of last term .
Yesterday as I was arriving home I saw him in your yard , Mack , he looked very satisfied . Curly was laying on the grass and ... "
I also choose climbing .
Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theater restaurant , but it was closed .
I will be expecting to hear from you .
His act was not good , and he did n't seem to like acting . Even my son could act better .
Now my dream will come true .
I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre 's " Over The Rainbow . "
Everything in fashion passes away in a couple of months and has to be created again .
Write to me soon and tell me if you want to join us for 2001 .
LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH MY MOTHER .
I 've always enjoyed the hazard and this time getting the password was , indeed , a tough cookie .
I apologize for any inconvenience , and I am waiting for your reply .
I was just walking down by the dressing room and the manager asked if I could help them .
The performances were great , but some halls were too small to accommodate as many people as there were that day .
At first , I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor , but something must have been changed since there was a different actor .
It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming .
Is it a very expensive area ?
I am pleased to have the opportunity to practice sports , as well .
In my opinion , in the future people will wear clothes made of natural fabrics such as silk , cotton , leather , wool .
I would like to travel in June , as I have already arranged for a part-time job later this summer .
Firstly , the actors were n't those announced .
What should I bring to match the weather ?
What I realized was that they were not different from any of us , but they were called celebrities .
I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time .
Now I am happy to give you all the information you need .
Also , I prefer sleeping in a tent than in a log cabin because it is easier to clean .
We think and speak about it in our families .
My name is Paula , and I 'm one of your latest visitors of your show , " Over the Rainbow " . This is also the reason for my letter .
There are many historical buildings remaining .
Can you guess who they chose for the job , me , yes me . I could n't believe it .
Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colors was , I consider myself very successful .
All of a sudden , a weird creature popped into his dream .
Technology changes our daily life . It makes our life easier to live and of course more comfortable with computers , televisions , radios , etcetera , and sometimes more secure , like in medicine .
I was very happy because this time I had a chance to talk to them and to know more about them .
Everybody is free to dress for the party , but be appropriate .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Amazingly , doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time . Shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains .
To be honest , the next great invention of people , computers , ca n't work if you do n't have phones .
At work , we have the most important thing in the world of technology : the computer . Without that , we ca n't do anything today .
According to the advertisement I have seen , it is supposed to show the latest fashions , leisure and sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles .
I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams .
I look forward to hearing from you .
If I find something special to visit in three hours . I will call you .
I like to face people whom I do n't even know .
I would like to try it this time .
The first week was fine , but on the second week , I got very sick .
It was very sorrowful news to Richard Brown .
During my holidays in London , I went to see your musical show .
I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the information that you have asked me for .
Secondly , I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kinds of music . In this case , the main problem was that some concert halls were too small , and because of it I could n't see one of the concerts in the program .
I got their address so we can visit them one day .
Technology is in every part of our lives .
Even if my parents do n't look after me for all matters like going out at night or studying , you do n't have to think that living in my house is like living in heaven , because I ca n't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends for a Saturday night party .
I was one of the few of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town .
We would be terribly grateful if you accepted our offer .
However , the rest of the students and I , have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London , where the latest fashions will be shown .
NOBODY TOLD US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES , AND WE WANT YOU TO GIVE US BACK OUR MONEY .
Please give this your careful consideration .
Apart from this , computer 's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at any moment I want . Five years ago , when I did not have a computer , I had to write letters which was a slower way to contact people .
I just imagined what it was like to be a singer .
This is a very interesting question for us and maybe very important too .
It was a kind of map that showed the place for a lot of money which robbers had hid .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum !!!
Everyone was so jealous in the school .
But you ca n't imagine who the singer was . It was Sting , can you imagine ?
Secondly , technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do many more things than before .
All of us must notice this fact .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because I got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month vacation each year . During the other months , I will be very busy because my workmates will take vacation on those months .
And also it is very interesting to talk with writers .
Both of them are convenient for getting there .
I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won and I am writing to you in order to give you all the details you need .
Finally , I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after the show , but it was closed because they were refurbishing the interior .
I arrived in Ireland on July 2nd .
I saw the musical show in your advertisement on my vacation .
However , it also can make our life very lazy .
I am writing in order to complain about the musical show , " Over the Rainbow . "
In the end he wins , but before he is able to get back he has to " sacrifice " his fish to attacking sharks .
It was like a dream .
I really think it sounds so interesting .
I would like to go only in July , because I have set my vacation for this month since last January .
It is going to be very lovely and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises for the students .
Unfortunately , it was used to kill a lot of people .
They were replaced by less famous actors .
This year , I started a private school in Dijon .
It is a famous exhibition , which shows the latest fashions , leisure , sportswear , makeup , and hairstyles .
I feel as free as an eagle .
I 've got other questions : which type of clothes do I have to bring ?
If that 's not enough , after the show my boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theater 's restaurant , but the unpleasant surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on vacation .
At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes . Jeans are not allowed .
In the end , I was happy that I had done this job .
At home , young people should help their parents do some housework .
Therefore , we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect Altrui in his privacy .
You will understand how upsetting all this was . So I decided to visit your restaurant , thinking that could save my visit to the theater , but it was closed and I had to go back to my hotel feeling mad and hungry .
I really want to talk about my recent experience .
The party will finish quite late , so we 've decided to provide a bus which will take you to the hotel safely .
So , men have invented machines to help him on his tasks , but nowadays , we are becoming slaves of them .
The next weekend I have an appointment with one them , but I do n't tell you the name because you 'll feel jealous !
First , I would like to travel in July , because before then I do n't have time to travel .
Neighbors have complained about loud music .
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression .
Speaking of my work , I had to mostly make the concert stage with some fellows .
People had completely different lifestyles .
Another thing I have to complain about is the time of the theater .
Another sport I love is basketball .
Among all these , the theater restaurant was closed , because the chef and the waiters were on vacation .
I think you never realize this until you 're not part of the crowd .
We could listen for free !
It would be a great opportunity because for students it 's free for students .
They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party .
I am writing from Paris , where I live .
I look forward to hearing from you soon and if you could send me a brochure of this holiday I would be grateful .
I still believe it has only been a dream !
I have never imagined I would have to face this situation .
There are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television , radio , fax machines , and microwaves .
Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss in the past , now , and also in the future .
It was the very last day of my trip and at that time I was in Kyoto .
I really recommend this book , it is fabulous .
Clothes that used to be made out of cotton , nowadays , are made out of almost anything .
At the end of the conference there is a party , a perfect opportunity for your students to meet new friends from all parts of the world and they could speak about their experience .
Firstly , I wanted to see Dann Block playing as your advertisement had said , but there was a different actor instead of him that evening .
I am waiting for your reply .
I 'm writing to complain about your current musical , which I saw last week .
You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference , it only takes ten minutes approximately .
As you know , I finished school two years ago .
I would like to travel in July , because it is the only month that I will be able to take days off .
I would like to ask you what type of clothes should I bring ?
All the flashing lights and the color changes , I mean , i believe they helped very much ..
In the winter , you 'll freeze .
It could be an advantage !
They will bounce on roads with their balloon clothes .
The second reason is the weather .
Yes , it is the TV .
How is your sister , Marine ?
On the other hand I would like to request all details of accommodation and , if you could , specify what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to take .
I also recommend window shopping .
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
The conference will be held in The Royal Hall , and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus .
We will pay Curly 's doctor with these money that we will earn " Pat said .
Another thing was that the show I went to was starting at 19 : 30 but it started at 20 : 15 !
I am allowed to take vacation only in July .
Please , bring me with you , in your reality ! "
If I use e-mail it is much easier and cheaper . And I can send e-mail anytime .
I wish you all the best !
I prefer that kind of accommodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but not in a tent .
Because of this situation , I 'll be very busy on the first week of July . I 'll appreciate it if you can give me the choice to start my " Camp California " on July 10th .
" He is so bad .
In fact there would be only one possibility in July , because I will end with my exams session at the end of that month and begin a practical training the 1st of August .
Therefore , I would like my money back .
Unfortunately your advertisement about it was n't true !
If you choose the post , you would be exhausted by the end of the concert .
Can you believe that I was helping in the last Britney Spears 's concert ?
Anyway , I think that 's it for now .
At the end , in my opinion , it would be interesting to film a sports class in order for our parents to realize that we improve our bodies , and not only our brains in school .
Thank you very much for this occasion . I 'd like to travel only in July , because in the rest of the year , I 'm working in a bank .
Could I suggest that you consider changing the program ?
Anything as a souvenir would be quite enough for me .
I have to add that the weekend ticket was an ideal way to sell all the events .
Consequently , I hope that it is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July , when the company I work with suspends its activities .
But we have to accept that everyone has their private life . For example , when we get married or when policeman stop us on the highway , we do n't want any stranger to notice what is happening to us .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
I really do n't know why she behaves herself so badly during her interviews .
I would prefer to live in the tent cabin , I think it is more comfortable .
It closed at 11 pm .
Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me .
This is mostly because I have a job and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months .
But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time .
I want you to know about the extraordinary moments I had with my friends at the festival .
At the end I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect and I would be glad if you could pay me some money back .
I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE GOOD .
Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk , eggs , or cheese .
I really got to know them after the concert .
From the list of all activities , I have chosen photography and golf .
Furthermore , sometimes you can not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low quality product .
There are links between the greenhouse , technology , and me .
In the advertisement for the show , you said that one of the starring actors was going to be Danny Brook , and to my surprise it was a different actor , and it really disappointed me .
Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine .
During the afternoon , Tim and I spent the hours before the concert playing in the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held .
We saw an advertisement about the Fashion And Leisure Show .
However , I have some proposals about improving it next year .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
We bought the tickets and then we sat down to rest .
Can you believe you can come in contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want ?
Pat went to Anna 's , and she seemed really unhappy .
Therefore , people used to shopping weekly or monthly .
So , I am going to choose Golf and Tennis .
Fortunately , it is not far from our college .
Believe it or not , I put makeup on one famous singer 's face .
They are filled by people who want to buy everything .
There is a storm and they can not leave .
On the other hand , and as a conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable , and surrounded by lots of gadgets with different functions .
He kept forgetting his lines .
Fist of all , it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is the hottest month in the year , and the weather shall be really nice .
It was our family 's secret .
I learned from your letter that I 've won the first prize .
We had been trapped in the snowy , almost vertical slopes of the " Tête Blanche " for more than ten hours by then .
It seems ages since I wrote to you .
During my time in California , I would love to have the chance for some leisure activities such as swimming . It is my favorite sport .
With this prize , I can choose two activities , ca n't I ?
Firstly , there was a different actor instead of the famous actor , Danny Brook .
In my opinion staying in log cabins is funnier and much cleaner .
I am not satisfied with your show as it was completely different from the advertisement .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
On my third day I helped them to install the sound system .
Although the show was supposed to be London 's newest and best musical show , I am rather disappointed with it .
First of all , the principal character was not Danny Brook , but a substitute , and the theater had not notified the audience about this change before .
I ca n't imagine if I had been caught .
Secondly , the show should have started at 19 : 30 , but it started at 20 : 15 .
We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention . Time is not a really problem .
That is why I would like to do that .
Well , it was the best time of my life !
However , the press should n't create rumors and hunt these people like animals .
If you have any time left you ought to go to High Street , where you could go shopping .
It reveals their attitude to life and their character .
Students start their day at the gym , where they learn the importance of being fit , that is way I suggest to film this activity .
I went to this festival with four friends , and all of us enjoyed our time very much .
I also would like to get some information about weather .
As I saw from your advertisement in the newspaper , it said " Starring : Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . "
Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills , making this a trip to remember .
And the restaurant of the theater was being painted , so I could not go as you said in the advertisement .
In the future , we wo n't buy clothes by size or even color . Our clothes will adapt to our body , the weather , and our fit according to our necessities .
I mean , would £700 be enough for me for one week ?
Thank you very much for your letter on 1/6/00 . I was really amazed with the news that I 'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
You know , he is my favorite singer .
I was very disappointed !
What you expect when you go shopping , generally with a friend or two , is wandering around and looking at everything .
We 're waiting for your answer , receive our greetings .
Do you know what Kim , I 've never thought that enjoying yourself like this could be so weird .
I am really surprised that I have won .
What do you think about that ?
But the differences between the homes of the rich and the poor will be the same in the future .
Luckily , I could keep my secret for a couple of days , but then it became urgent , and I needed someone to talk to .
I did n't have my mobile phone with me and I was half way between my school and home .
I thank you very much for hearing my request . I apologize for any inconvenience it could make . I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to " The London Fashion and Leisure Show , " on behalf of all the students .
The party will be nice .
Firstly , I would like to mention that in our daily life we always use some technological machines . For instance , a TV-set , stereo , microwave oven , and others .
If it could be possible , we can do an interview with the last winner .
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
Nonetheless , people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake .
I am looking forward to receiving your reply with my money .
The most important thing will be the figure , such as long legs or pear-shaped .
We were allowed to go out if we did n't want to stay in class .
I told you that I helped at a pop concert last month .
With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisement , I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event , and some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take in consideration .
All I have to do is buy and choose .
Firstly , I have to say that I can travel only in July this year .
The reason behind my choice of singing is because I feel embarrassed about my voice , so maybe I could make it better .
When I saw the advertisement of the show it was written that the show would start at half past seven , but it started at a quarter past eight .
Afterwards , they talked to me and thanked me for helping them in those exciting moments .
Thirdly , the disappointment made me a bit hungry , but the restaurant was closed without any sign saying why .
We think that if you do n't have any problem , we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery , so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
As you know , I am a member of a BSB fan club , and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live .
I think it can make your festival more popular .
Back in the 30 's , the different governments invented guns , battleships , and all kinds of weapons for their armies .
That 's why I 'd like to ask if you could give me some money back .
As well as all the treasures , statues , and historical paintings , there are also restaurants and modern galleries .
In spite of our decadence , some cheap souls still have the courage to say that , by shopping , they 're filling their empty spaces .
The bus will be in service at 9 : 30 PM and 11 : 30 PM , then at the end of the party will be the last one .
I was disappointed when I found out the actor was n't Danny Brook !
Consequently , I proposed to change the program as follows : on Tuesday afternoon , instead of shopping , we could go to this show and we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon , during our free time .
But , while reading realistic stories , I just fall deep into the story , into the writer 's own world .
Hopefully I will meet some other girls in the same sport , so we can all play as a team .
I always dreamed about going to California and now my dreams are coming truth .
Do you want to join me ?
The computer is very useful and it has affected our own lives in different ways .
It can show how much students are enjoying their life in our school .
We were there , alone , my friend with his broken leg and myself .
They are able to give and receive information very quickly .
In this book , Heathcliff as a child had a bad character . The situations he lived in with the family Earnshaw , where he grew up , made him rude , aggressive , and noisy .
The shopping center is just right opposite of the hotel . However , some people may want to just wait at the hotel , having a cup of coffee .
I hope you will consider my suggestion .
You do not have to waste money at all .
I must sign off as I want to catch the post .
That means , for example , while you are sitting in the office you are able to control your home with the computer .
In my opinion , math , politics , Chinese , English , and painting lessons are the most interesting ones .
So , I will be very happy to improve my art at the camp .
I have good singing skills too .
I SUGGEST THAT WE GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING , AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE , WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW .
First of all , I think that famous people deserve to have private a life .
We will be more comprehensible with others .
I 'm writing this letter to you because during my stay in London , I went to the theater to see a musical show , and I had a very disappointing evening .
How is about an accommodation .
As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song , I saw a number of famous musicians nearby .
From the beginning of the century to now , modern technology has changed and made our daily life easier .
They are always expected to be beautiful , intelligent , and good-looking .
I was very excited when I got to see a star !
So , I read Agatha Christie 's , " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie . "
Believe me , shopping can also be painful .
So staying in log cabins will probably avoid a lot of problems .
In your previous letter , you asked for information about interesting buildings to visit in my country .
The school works together with known companies such as Marriott hotel , Air France , and Princess Cruises , among others in order to provide students with high qualified training .
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders , I knew I had to see it .
They ca n't communicate with ordinary children or attend ordinary schools .
I would like to travel in July because I am a student , therefore I only have holidays in this part of the year .
The ticket for the show is included .
I 'm writing to you because I want you to give the money back for your " London 's newest and best musical show : 'Over the Rainbow ' , " presented in the Circle Theatre .
When I received your letter with photographs of that flat , it really looked nice .
Another thing is that there was no discount available , so we spent a lot of money on such a bad show .
The building is upgraded every year .
I have also been told that they were going to make a music video from that concert , so I tried as hard as I could .
In addition to that , realistic stories are more attractive . I personally do n't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they can not be true .
I am excited and looking forward to going to camp there .
I am very delighted to visit Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks .
But I think I will choose basketball and photography , because basketball is the only sport I can play well .
Moreover , students are allowed admittance for free .
As far as I am concerned , I would prefer an accommodation in a log cabin , but in case there are no cabins left , I can stay in a tent as well .
I made two albums about birds and floral life .
I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything .
I think that it would be nice to invite somebody to sing at the end-of-conference party and give the students the chance to enjoy themselves and dance .
Thank you for asking me my taste and to be preoccupied with it .
I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved , bad-tempered , and angry with the world for interfering in their lives .
I 'd like to change a rule at home .
I want to say thank you that I was the lucky person who won that competition .
After the show , I decided to have dinner in your theater restaurant , but I could n't because it was closed .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
About the accommodation , I would prefer to sleep in the tents , because I never been in one , and it is a lot more fun than log cabins .
" Reading the gossips " : Is n't it what anyone of us loves doing ??
This story happened a long time ago .
I hope my recommendations will help you with choosing a building to visit .
When I went there , it was closed .
Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
I have taken a photography course and I enjoy taking photos of animals .
Someone says it is math , which is practical and useful ; but the majority says it is boring , unless you 've chosen a job which requires all your math knowledge , such as accounting , otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer .
AT 8 : 00 , we stopped at a coffee house to eat . They shouted : " At 8 : 30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave . "
I am looking forward to staying in contact with you .
I AM WRITING TO YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU .
I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July .
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value , but morality and principles should also be considered .
As a result , journalists should respect their life and always write real news .
I went to the theater last weekend to see " Over the Rainbow " .
I have something really exciting to share with you .
I will start an Italian course in August . It will be impossible for me to leave .
The show began later , much later than your advertisement states , at about 20 : 15 . The show started 45 minutes late .
By the way , I 'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should prepare , and how much I should bring .
They just said , " We do n't give money back . "
Otherwise if you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood .
It 's a great opportunity because in our fast developing world we have to look fashionable , and this kind of show happens quite rarely .
Technology is the thing that makes our lives easy .
I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on the 5th of April is suitable for you .
But we had to use the uniform , and we had to study a lot to pass the exams .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me about the two weeks at Camp California that I won .
Thanks a lot for your letter .
Moreover , I practiced a lot of aspects of my speciality . For me , it was most important to gain real experience .
Technology is essential to our life ; we need it every minute , every second .
Regarding your questions , the following are my answers .
The stars had been changed , the show had started only at 20 : 15 , and there were no discounts available .
So you will enjoy traditional foods , music , dances and games from all over the world .
According to the advertisement , Danny Brook would be starring , but it was a different actor .
A survey has been done , and the issue is which subjects ( lessons ) and activities the students think are the most enjoyable .
Well , I tried to do so but the lady at the desk told me that there were quotas available at that price , but were already sold out !
This military technology has affected our lives more than what we think because most of the equipment we use was originally created by those people .
I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars .
When an important date is coming , it tells me .
Paul was wondering whether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words , " I am glad to meet you , Paul . "
From one side , these people chose to become public people .
I would like to travel in July , because it is the summer and the weather is sunny ; moreover , I am totally free during that month .
Also , we would like to go to the London Fashion And Leisure Show , which was advertised in the newspaper " Metro " yesterday .
I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying clothes .
It would also be very interesting to film the situation during the break : the smokers in the schoolyard , the Buffett , and the other pupils , who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework .
Unfortunately , I will be able to go only in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for those dates .
It will be very awful .
I love swimming , and I have a scuba diving license .
Technology nowadays is something everybody has on their own minds .
Do you have any rules at school that make you upset ?
My family loves him very much and supports us .
It has free entrance for students .
Maybe children will not have to go to school , they just will stay in their rooms and study from computers like some kind of online education .
Secondly , it was supposed to start at 19 : 30 but actually started at 20 : 15 , forty-five minutes later !
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future .
We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people .
Finally , I appreciate your organization and look forward to hearing from the next International Arts Festival .
All the students in my class are excited about one more thing .
It was n't a usual fish , it was a Gold Fish and it asked him as a human , " Please , let me go and I can do for you anything you want . "
You have to read it yourself , and if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book !
However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March .
When I stay home , I can watch or listen to the radio , etc. , so modern technology helps me to spend my free time .
As I explained it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have , and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before .
After the play , which turned out to be just as bad as I thought , I wanted to relax in the theater restaurant , but it was closed for no reason !
Even if I worked hard on it , I was very surprised to win the first prize .
Almost everything is connected to computers , for example , education , researching of the Universe , and others .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
Moreover , the play did not start at the time it was supposed to .
The reason for choosing these two activities is that they contrast themselves ; I want one more exciting and that asks for more agility and another more calm and relaxing , that asks only for my ability to paint .
We would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hear from you soon .
There is sometimes a real fight over who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician .
About two weeks ago , I went to London for a week long vacation .
Also , they are presenting their first play on the 2nd of July .
New technologies and facilities wo n't improve the relationship between people .
Realistic stories , thus , develop our imagination and creativity , which are essential in our lives .
It 's one of the most important things for me to have a chance to forget about my present , luxurious life and to try doing something different .
Another aspect is that children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention .
To begin with , in your letter you asked me when I would like to travel .
I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to " The London Fashion and Leisure Show , " on behalf of all the students .
I want to play tennis and swim .
MY NAME IS JAMES CAMIREZ AND I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday .
As I did n't expect to be successful , I am very happy about this result .
" What will clothes be like 100 years from now ? "
Each of us had a different task .
I think that it will have a similar structure , but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer . For example , we can turn on the lights of the bedroom just by pressing a button while we are watching TV sitting on the sofa .
What do you think about this plan ?
On the last day , I will go to your house , and then we 'll think about our conference plan .
Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .
I prefer to live in tents because I feel very natural .
On the other hand , if you think that you 'll be on the red , I 'd rather stay at home .
The people backstage , including me , were helping to clean up all the stuff and getting ready for the end of the concert .
Mathematics teachers do great loads of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons .
Finally , I 'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience in my life .
It was not our fault that we went in after 11 pm .
I am really happy to receive a letter about Camp California from you .
We could n't imagine our life without them .
I realized that it was a different actor playing instead of Danny Brook .
What appeared to also be wrong is that there were supposed to be discounts for the tickets .
From the beginning it was all a disappointment .
Most of them are apartments which have at least 20 Floors .
I 'm not quite a young man and during the past years of my life I have become accustomed to some more comfort .
After a while , she pulled herself together and paused for a minute .
But in the other hand , I have never done surfing . I am a complete beginner , but I am dying to do it .
Fashion of the Future .
At the ticket office , I also asked for a discount but they told me that was n't possible , though your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available !
I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included .
I would like to ask if you could expand the plays and films more for next year .
After the show we went to the theater restaurant , but it was closed .
It made it possible to discover and to talk with new people on the internet but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parents .
I done not a clue about it .
I was thinking , " What should I do ? "
When I need to buy something , I usually ca n't find it and then shopping becomes a nightmare .
Finally , I would like to inquire about how much money I should take with me , and also what kind of clothes would be most suitable to wear .
So , I am very grateful to man who invented them . Unfortunately , I have forgotten his name .
Finally , I would like to ask you what kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp , the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me , and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
The saleswomen are too busy and scarcely have a moment to give you a council service .
It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight .
I do n't know why , and I 'd like you to tell me the reason .
We spent 2 weeks with the family .
They wanted to be famous and they had known the price before .
Do you want to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping at last month ?
HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE ?
I 'm going to help them again .
Also , I would prefer to go swimming and surfing , because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool , so I am good at swimming .
In my opinion shopping is just to cover our basic needs .
Every day , I , like everybody else , watch TV , watch International news , listen to the radio , play games on my computer , or communicate with American or Asian people without going out of my house .
I am one of your husband 's students .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Firstly , I helped selling the tickets .
What is impressive about this building , is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
Finally , could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes , towels , and extra money ?
It 's a good chance for you to improve on your English .
Clothes are part of each culture and one of those things which express our taste and personality .
It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment .
Regarding the end-of-conference party , I would suggest women wear some type of dress and an elegant suit for men , though it is not formal .
We have organized to do the party between three to six o'clock in the afternoon in College Canteen . Regarding food , we organized a buffet ; but could you also help us with which music he prefers , if he prefers something especially .
I helped at a pop concert of a newcomer group and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
I would also take an outdoor lesson , " Training " .
You had to start the show at 19 : 30 p.m. but you started too late at 20 : 15 p.m without any explanation .
On my first day I did n't work .
Styles mix , colors and shapes come back from the past , and only the fabrics are different .
A friend of mine gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place .
Unfortunately , the musical show was annoying .
Last before least , I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America .
The queue is not the only problem . If you go by car , there is a parking problem ; if you go by bus , there is again a queue and you have to carry many carrier bags during the your journey and you wo n't always be lucky to find a seat .
But , I 'm really happy that I had even a small role in making people enjoy themselves .
I would have preferred it if you had informed us before .
The other one is the television .
As above mentioned , please take care to give me more information , and if you 'd like to know more , please telephone me for further discussion .
We often go out to sing in Karaoke bars .
I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have been paid .
Firstly , what kind of clothes do I have to take to the camp , clothes for hot or cold weather ?
I am not really satisfied with it .
First , what clothes should I bring ?
I remember that I agreed to look after your apartment while you are in New York on vacation .
Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not , and overall it is not always enjoyable .
I did not get a discount .
I know you have good taste in presents !!
It was said that it would start at 7 : 30 , but it did not .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held .
I am very interested in going for two weeks to Camp California in the USA .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there are people from only six countries .
I am looking forward to travelling .
The reason that I am writing is due to the fact that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Besides , the theater restaurant had closed down before I got out of the show .
Technology , are we prepared for those advances ?
However , we have seen an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
A crowded hall is not good to enjoy music .
I have sung in the church 's choir for three years , and I have had singing classes at school since first grade .
50 years ago , Korean mothers would have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food .
So , I have some opinions on this , which I would like to voice .
Anyway , we still want to go to the science museum and shopping as well but , we think we can go shopping on the last day of our trip .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The festival was very well organized with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows .
Thank you very much for your letter , I was glad to get it and know a lot of news about you .
It would be appreciated it if you supply some towels , if possible .
I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think about my health .
I was very surprised when I saw that singers are n't so sophisticated and self-confident as they are written about in the newspapers .
What is it that we use every day for many hours ? Sometimes from early in the morning until late in the evening .
I think if we wear these clothes , we will travel everywhere easier when we use cars , ships , planes , and spaceships .
In the future , it will be able to help people even more since it has been increasing its capacity day after day .
To sum it up , I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent , reasonably-priced tickets like this year 's .
The other bad point was the time the show started . It was already 20 : 15 when the first star entered the scene . Your advertisement said 19.30 !
People also use the telephone for their personal life . For example , when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has considerably been changed by rapidly developing modern technology .
I received your letter this morning and I was very surprised by it .
You can not only listen to her best detective stories , but also learn English automatically .
The only problem is that on the 4th of April , I have my graduation .
Modern technology has changed my daily life from physical activity to mental activity .
The problem is when I want to buy only one thing , for example , bread . On Friday evenings and on weekdays , each supermarket is crowded .
The activities are quite hard to choose , really , because you have a lot of choices , which I like .
Finally , I would like to ask you for some further information about the clothes and the money we will need .
Another problem is that I believed that discounts were available ; however , there was n't any discount .
She is very intelligent .
What we all did was make many cups of coffee and help to find their missing socks or any other clothing .
We can love them without disturbing them too .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Instead of going shopping , we could go to the show .
Besides all these improvements and comfort I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us .
In every country , there are famous people who receive a lot of public attention .
In addition to this , it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us because for the students , it is completely free .
In conclusion , I think that people who are too interested in other people 's lives , do n't have an interesting life and are unhappy !
First of all , could you let us know if the date of June 16th is all right with his timetable program .
What do you think if we go visit the art museum ?
In 1874 , Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city ( a small town near Savannah ) .
I learned painting when I was a student .
In conclusion , I wanted to say thanks for such a special weekend .
Its first application was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from all around the world for only a reasonably priced ticket for the whole weekend .
When I was a child , I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked , but it was nearly impossible to have them .
So when I read about other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught , I got very angry and annoyed .
On the other hand , I would like to note that the festival would be appealing to more people if a few improvements were made .
This is an experience I 'll never forget .
After all that , at the end of the musical I went to your theater restaurant to have dinner . I left home without eating and I was hungry at that time .
It closed at 10 pm , but the show finished at 10 : 30 pm .
First of all , I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook . Sadly he was n't there . He was filled in by a different actor , who was rather disappointing .
We lived here in a rush , but there was a lot of fun too .
If I want to buy a nice pair of shoes , I 'll have to go into a city center and browse around from shop to shop until I find the shoes I like .
However , I have never tried to go surfing .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
If the door is broken , we can replace it rapidly , and it is not expensive when it is plastic .
Well , I suppose that almost everything in future houses will be automatic and will obey what people say .
I always had my own key and unlocked the door by myself .
As for me , the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer .
I am writing to tell you about my experience in last month 's pop concert , where I was helping my friend Nick , who was the bouncer for the place .
Suddenly a murder happens !
I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions !
In your advertisement , you announced that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Moreover , once I was going to pay for the tickets , I found another thing : there were no discounts available .
When I needed some information , I had to go to library to find it in books or newspapers .
I am looking forward to your reply letter .
Without doubt , the discovery of the computer is the most important technological event .
While never leaving the office , you are able to heat the water for a hot bath .
I was so disappointed .
I am writing to you in order to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival .
BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORST , BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES OF PLAYING IN THE THEATRE .
Your advertisement said " discounts available , " but they were not available .
I am able to meet my friends quickly on the internet just by clicking the mouse .
Maybe it is better to say in an apartment instead of a building .
Last May , I had a week-long holiday in London , and during my trip , I decided to buy tickets for " Over Over the Rainbow , " the musical show .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
They are famous , but I think they need to be alone sometimes .
It looked at me and said .
The director of the college has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice .
They also took me to an after party , and they asked me if would like to do this again .
Due to the fact that my children have summer vacation in July and I 'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog , I prefer to stay in log cabins .
I would rather type some coursework up than hand-write it .
Firstly , I found that there were no discounts as was announced in the advertisement .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scary .
I let this pass and I bought it anyway , thinking that it was only a mistake in your advertisement .
If it is possible , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollen .
Recently I visited an arts festival , organized with your help .
Can we find some places to buy ?
I 'd like to join the activities swimming and singing .
Finally , I helped them , and in return I had good experience as well as enjoyed listening to music .
No doubt she would never ever look at me again .
We have to think about it this way .
Where 's the fun in that ?
I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances .
During break time , I did give a lots of direction to people who could n't find the toilet , and information such as where they could have a cup of coffee .
The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer .
You can go on Saturdays , but sadly , there are too many costumers ; you ca n't walk or try on clothes , and it 's very hot .
It was really great .
I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city . I look forward to meeting you at this conference .
The show finished late .
I look forward to seeing you .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
Probably , because their parents have n't enough time to go out of the city and show them nature .
The Barbican Centre , built in 1975 , is near to banks and important offices .
I am now writing this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure .
These things all provide me convenience .
I have given a lot of information about the international student conference .
So in fact , people 's homes will become more convenient and comfortable .
Finally , could you tell me how far is the nearest town or village ?
Is it hot enough ?
On top of this , we intended on going to the theater restaurant which was closed because of building activities .
Lastly , it could be nice to students who are interested in arts , if you help special events , for instance : song contest , writing competition , or dance lessons .
Even though I had planned something else to do , I agreed because she 's my very good friend .
From any point of view , the future home will be very similar to the homes we have today .
First , I 'll tell you the name of the hotel , it 's the Palace Hotel .
It has been so long since I wrote to you the last time ...
Anyway , I 'll tell you about my wonderful experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert .
Nowadays , it 's getting obvious that designers sold only details , but significant changes do n't turn up .
This event was not what I call : " a perfect evening out , " as your advertisement promised .
The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing stones back and shooting everyone with BB guns .
The biggest disadvantage is pollution .
In addition to this , the show did not start on time , 19 : 30 , so I had to wait for 45 minutes .
The designer will have a lot of ideas on how to make very nice and useful clothes .
To begin with , the actor you published was going to perform did n't .
I think it was the water .
I am really looking forward to take part at Camp California .
The machine was used to read this card and was so big , you used to need a room .
The end-of-conference party is designed to give rough ideas about many different cultures .
There , we will have the chance to try makeup or new hairstyles .
Because the London Fashion program takes place on Tuesday , I would suggest you change your plan .
I immediately said yes and so did my friend .
I understand you want to know when am I available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed , so I ran to my brother in order to explain to him what I had seen .
She will come to Liverpool next week and I 'll put her up .
I am writing to complain about a musical show I went to a week ago .
It contains a wide range of activities , for example , sightseeing , a river trip , visiting the science museum , gallery , and shopping .
I feel entitled to compensation for this event .
Thank you for organizing the trip to London .
Secondly , could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin , because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents .
The most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN A VERY NEAR FUTURE .
If you do , please tell me .
Pat told him that I was in love with him .
Perhaps , there will be personal computers which will control everything , every item of furniture , light , and temperature .
It was unbelievable and tiring as well .
Last but not less important , is the class called " Know-How " , which shows students how to cope with unexpected problems even if they are in stress .
I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring .
I am writing to give information on a very interesting building to visit .
I hope I 'll be able to travel in July . Due to the fact that my children have summer vacation in July and I 'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog , I prefer to stay in log cabins .
I hope we join the next pop concert together as a staff and enjoy our time !
So you see my point .
I hope this is n't offending you too much ...
Thank you very much for the many interesting activities in this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are sure , will be very exciting .
I know , they are not like us .
In general , the rules at private schools are much stricter than the ones at state schools .
All the rubbish , dust , dirty dishes , plates , and caps will be washed and cleaned automatically .
" You see , I am a mere product of your mind , but I would like to go out of the heavy sleep .
The restaurant should have been open when I came out , but it was closed because of the hour the show finished .
I am just coming back from a week 's holiday in London , which has been , all in all , really nice .
Let me know if you are going to come so that I prepare the bedroom to put you up .
In addition , we are fascinated with their marriage , children , vacations , etc .
The people who were there to watch the show were very angry , and they were shouting because they were waiting for too long . I absolutely agree with them .
You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have buying clothes , jewels , furnitures , etc . You could have a real great time .
But the positive way new technology has changed my life is in ways to communicate .
Firstly , I hoped to have relaxing entertainment with your musical show but it was not the case .
I 'm waiting for you reply .
I would also like to know some more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which will be necessary for me to take .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
You should review the advertisements you do because you give wrong information .
However , we saw an advertisement , and we are keen on the idea of going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Her boyfriend , Guy Richie , was there too , and he 's a really good person .
I prefer to come at 19 : 30 , because it is better at night and it would n't finish late , but the theater started at 20 : 15 and we got bored waiting to start .
Communications move the world and famous people use them to improve their work , politicians for their campaigns , and film stars to promote their last movie .
No matter that people started worrying more about pollution in the world .
A couple of weeks later , my sister called me while I was at work ; completely devastated and weeping scalding tears , she could hardly pronounce a word .
Getting from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St . James College , where the conference will take place .
Anyway , what you wanted to know was what has been my job .
We think it will be a great opportunity , because it will take place during our visit to London , on the 14th of March .
And it 's not ending , I hope that for my thirties I 'll go to Mars on vacation ...
At the end of the summer , we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia .
This is a precise letter that I write to you now .
There are some things I would like to ask : the type ( and quantity ) of clothes I will have to bring , if it is necessary to bring some money , and any additional stuff ( like raincoats ) .
Everything is easy now .
So , we would be grateful if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
Another important thing is that despite the number and quality of films there were , from my point of view , not many plays .
My job was very easy , I had to help Sting in everything . For example if he wanted water , I had to give him water . It was marvellous .
Thank you for your answer .
But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt whether to use it or not . Especially now , when " big-mouth " Pat spread the news to literally everyone .
In this domain , you have to afford everyday the development of new technology .
When the play " Over the Rainbow " finished , I tried to eat something but the fact was that the theater restaurant was closed , because your personnel were cleaning a mess that an old dog did .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work . My current post finishes at the end of June , but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
First of all , I recommend you get on the 8 a.m. boat .
In my opinion , technology has made human life easier , funnier , and more comfortable .
Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
She 'll probably come with a friend . If you want you can enjoy us .
Technology allows us to have more time for distractions or to do other things we really like to .
If our homes are made out of plastic and also our windows made out of plastic , then we can have our homes for a long time .
He / she can just press the button or send an e-mail to operate what he / she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .
I am writing to express my disappointment about the play " Over the Rainbow " which is performing at Circle Theatre .
It was n't very pleasant .
Then I can prepare my clothes suitably for that weather .
So , I wanted to know if there will be more films next year .
Every person in the world looks to technology everyday to improve the way they live their own life .
It felt like a good memory to remember and remind ourselves to speak in a correct way .
But sometimes I ask myself if the " ancient world " without science , technological discoveries , and industries was more authentic than the current one .
Concerning the singing activities , I think I 'm quite good as I have been in my school 's choir for 3 years .
I said yes , and I am sure it was the best decision of my life .
Specifically , I like water painting .
I appreciate this shop for lots of products , cheap prices and big spaces .
It is also expensive , and I ca n't afford to stay there too long .
Here is the information which you asked from me .
It also changed my free time . They have invented great games like Playstation , and you can have a really good time with your friends playing .
Actually , they came from only six countries .
I was really disappointed with the other actor 's performance .
This way we could obtain rare spots at NASA University .
All of them were shocked by what they heard and they started to talk about it everywhere .
It is a good start to go sightseeing by bus on Monday morning . We can see all the famous buildings in a few hours .
Personally I do n't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops , so I buy all I can using online services .
Finally , it was a very nice day with great experience .
I think that if we mix lessons with sport activities the combination will give us complete success .
I 'm sure we will find another solution .
I do n't like to imagine my house or my life without all this facilities in winter when it 's dark very early , and I need to spend my free time at home .
One story is about ten people who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
However , I go far away from my family and other people and have virtual relationships .
We hope you will enjoy it .
I helped in setting up the sound equipment , programming the light system on the computer , and tidying up Madonna 's room !
We prepared some special attractions like live dance , music , and hot or cold buffet .
I was very surprised about the result of the competition .
He actually went to Carla and told her everything .
As you can see , most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided .
I 'm very happy and lazy at the same time .
For example , the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor , but he was not .
This can save lives !
Although I wish for my accommodation at Camp California to be be in tents . I had that experience the last summer .
I would like to ask you for my money back .
I think , it was very clever of me to record that moment which I will never ever forget , and that was the thing that I liked most from that experience .
Based on everything listed above , I would like to receive £10 , which I have paid , back .
Unfortunately , it can be inconvenient for me because of pollution from cars and factories .
Furthermore , the show started at the wrong time .
During it , everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers of the conference .
It changes every day , and I do not know if we will be able to understand it .
Then , by some " strange power " my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it , but it was too difficult .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT. 10 MINUTES AFTER FOLLOWING HIM , I START GETTING TO KNOW THE PLACE , AND I WAS FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE .
After waiting a while in this uncomfortable place the show started . I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared , but I realized that the main one was n't Danny Brook , it was an impostor .
We know what you have done and your dog will be sold . "
However , I must say , it was quite the opposite .
Who of you could imagine life without the telephone ? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
Well , that will be all .
The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event .
Last month , I helped at a pop concert ; it was marvelous .
Fortunately , the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones .
It is very useful .
To make the matter worse , I had expected the ticket with a discount , but when I went to the ticket box , there was not any discount available .
By choosing this style of life they should have realized how their life would look .
I did n't get involved that much in writing a script because it was very hard and the director wrote most of it , but the main idea of the background of the stage was mine , and I am very proud of it .
Is there only one teacher for each sport , and how many are we in each group of activities ?
" Yes , Oh Lord he did it because we won his team at football " , Nick said .
I am very good at playing basketball .
First of all , I will be able to travel in July because I have not finished school .
Also , in the advertisement you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't . Also , people could visit the theater restaurant after the show to eat something or to have a drink .
In conclusion , if you shop reasonably , have a good time .
There are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight , moonlight , candlelight .
Now then , how was this advertising ? It was completely different . I am really disappointed with your musical . I am asking you for money back , because I did n't enjoy your musical .
Modern technology has changed my daily life in many respects .
I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends .
I go to the swimming pool two times a week , so I am good at this sport .
When I was younger , I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project , I would take a lot of time researching in libraries , looking for old books .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
From my point of view , people 's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine , TV , cooker , and light connecting to the owner .
So they can be ordinary people like us .
When you work in an office , a factory , or an organization , you have the same schedule as them . So you can only go shopping during your lunch break .
My name is John and I have been to the latest International Arts Festival .
As I told you in my last letter , I worked two weeks ago in Edinburgh helping at a pop concert .
I went to the " International Arts Festival " on 21-22 of November .
I was really excited with the idea of seeing that show .
I am willing to show you the autograph and the photograph .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I 've never been to California ; therefore , please let me know about the weather there .
Shopping is great when you have lots of money and time . You can buy clothes , shoes , makeup , CDs , whatever .
Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed until 20 : 15 .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definitely need one , and it holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistics on your computer for doing social research and some analysis .
Please send me a list of the items I may need there , including the most appropriate clothes for the American weather .
I was terribly disappointed .
Cellular phones can be inconvenient sometimes , but they can be very useful in certain situations : when your car is broken on the road , when you need to be found anywhere and at any time ( if you are a doctor , a lawyer , or a journalist , for instance ) , and so forth .
To make things even worse , the play did n't start at 19 : 30 as it was supposed to , but instead it started 45 minutes late , at 20 : 15 . There were n't even any of your famous discounts available .
I choose singing because I love singing and I am in a choir for 7 years now .
I am writing in response to it .
At the camp I would like to choose two activities , Painting and Singing . I love painting . In university I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint because I work in a bank and I have a baby .
I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday , the 14th of March at 10 : 00 - 19 : 00 .
As well as this , the stories are going to be read in English .
I am writing to provide you with the information you require .
Concerning the activities while at the camp , I would like to enjoy swimming , not because I am good at it , but because I am keen on it ; and the other one is photography .
So try to imagine my situation . I had paid a lot of money and I could n't see a good show . I am really disappointed .
There is one thing I would like to ask you about how much money I will need to go out at night and to spend on food and that kind of thing .
In my opinion , shopping is like relaxing .
I 'm writing to express my feelings and opinion about the International Arts Festival , which was held a few days ago .
I am writing to complain about the musical show I have seen last Friday in your theater .
Also , you can spend hours trying to decide between wonderful blue trousers or a beautiful black dress , for example .
It depends on every individual to change their mind and act as a " smart " shopper .
It starts early in the morning , as we wake up to the sound of an alarm clock . In the bathroom , we have hot water running and also the whole house is warm due to central heating .
Finally , my parents are arguing all the time about different solutions to my problem , and that 's all thanks to Pat .
I am writing to complain about your musical show .
Maybe you will spend all your money on a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to nightclub but you are short of money .
I think I would prefer climbing and painting .
I have chosen painting and photography .
Should I bring my camera , warm clothes , or any pocket money ?
I could be interested in your letter .
The pop group was all young people ( between 23 - 30 years old ) , and all of them were really nice .
During the entire day , I speak with the majority of my colleagues by telephone or e-mail .
I 'm writing you following our visit to your theater last night .
One day , while all their friends were there and talking , Pat told everyone that Pandora had done a robbery .
Thank you very much for your letter .
But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year 's festival to make it absolutely wonderful .
By the way , I 've understood I have n't had better trust in anybody .
How much money do I have to bring ?
First off all , I would like to say that it started later than it should have , and I had to wait for about forty minutes .
We have to face it - it has both sides .
I think also , housewives will receive more help with a robot in the household .
Male or female will not be important for clothes in 100 years .
I had to wait all that time on the street because the hall was not big enough .
You asked me about my experiences .
What , do you want more ?
Your dance shows are very beautiful , and art exhibitions are something original and exciting .
I am very glad that I have won first prize in your competition and I can go to the United States .
The restaurant should be open until the show is finished .
If you have more questions about the conference and anything else , do not hesitate to ask me .
Although the jazz , rock , and classical music were great , some concerts and halls were too small . Could you consider making them bigger next year ?
For accommodation I would prefer a tent , as I love nature and I like going camping a lot .
And what is the weather like ?
Lastly , the restaurant which was going to be open was in fact closed without a reason !
I 'm writing to you regarding the radio program next Saturday where " The Old Man and the Sea " by Earnest Hemingway will be read .
My daily life should be changed by these innovations !
The organizer of the concert asked my school for about 15 people who do art , to help decorate the stage .
I CAN NOT EXPRESS HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PRIZE .
One of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes . Our school is now the best of the country in all ages . We impress with this , as we can show what we do in order to be the best .
But she did , and she asked me out .
People have seen , in the last 10 years , how different our clothes have become .
For the activities , I would like to choose tennis , which I am not too bad at , and climbing , which I have never done but must be interesting .
Also , of course , the furniture of people 's homes will not be changed .
After the show , we went immediately to the box office to ask for our money back , but they were too strict and closed-minded .
It was a big fault to gave her a secret , especially an important one .
With the help of some modern technology , our daily life would not be so difficult .
It always happens with people , does n't it ?
We imagine that would be one of the best vacations in our lives .
They started charging down the field to fire , and once in range , everyone threw their balloon as far as they could .
Moreover , there were n't any discounts and all of the tickets had the same prices .
I sometimes want to hear their voice on the telephone .
The reason for this is global warming , which is the salvation of the problem and another reason why this idea is possible .
I helped with the selling of the tickets , with the security , with the designing ...
In addition , the resort has an interesting historical background , architecture , and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico ; for example , it provides differents kinds of tours around Mexico .
On the other hand , during my stay in Camp California , I want to go swimming because I practice this activity regularly and I often do competitions . This is one of my hobbies .
It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp .
I really look forward to receiving your reply soon .
Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone .
In my opinion it should be a rule which lets the media approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe .
To sum up , it is a big school where you have a lot of interesting lessons and some optional activities to do in your free time .
First of all , we are happy to have won the first prize in your competition .
I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan .
Choosing gives me such pleasure because I never have to worry about where I get money for my wishes .
Lastly , I would like to ask you about money and clothes .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July only because I have two months of vacation , which are July and August . I chose July because it is the only month that I think I 'm free .
Firstly , it is a good idea that the festival is international .
Do you know " Radio Head ? "
Moreover , they will be able to create a special climate for each room .
Another point is the time when it started - exactly 45 minutes later .
About the accommodation at Camp California , I would like to stay in a tent .
As you look around , everybody has a car or motorcycle .
I hope you will understand my disappointment and the reasons why I ask for my money back .
But on the other hand , people will still have to program them as they have to do nowadays .
I was wondering what kind of clothes we need , and about money and meals . Are meals provided ?
Finally , we should film the lunch , which is also a moment to relax for the students , and for the teachers . We must n't forget to film the teacher room because if a school is made of students , it 's also made of teachers .
The tickets were a little expensive , but I was with TEN other people , so when we read " Discounts Available " we expected that the theater had organized a special discount for groups of numerous people .
The two activities I have chosen are basketball and tennis .
So , what are we going to do ?
If only I could sing beautifully !
However , you changed actors without informing viewers .
In addition , I would like to talk about the success among most visitors of the weekend ticket due to its economical price and because of its ease of use .
First of all , I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
When the band had just started to play , lots of girls started to jump , the fans getting very close to them . Some of the girls started to take their clothes off , which was the best part for me , but security went there and took them away .
It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy , shops have plenty of every kind of thing .
Secondly , there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small .
We have seen your program , and like all of those , especially the Science Museum , it will good for us to increase our knowledge and so on .
In the future , they both are getting closer and closer .
Last , I have no experience abroad . Therefore I 'd like to know about the weather in California in July .
To conclude , in this short video , we must show thanks to our school which was able to make the best of us come out .
Both of them are my favorite sports , and I 'm quite good .
Do you know that this concert will be on television ?
It is a very good program , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class will enjoy .
I am very happy to know I won the prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A .
When the show started , the person who was acting in it was not Danny Brook and he seemed not to be an actor .
It is well know in almost all families , often with a lot of different channels .
Hey Listen guys we will take his dog , which he loves very much , and we will sell it to Sally who wants one .
Firstly , I was designated to sell tickets .
After that , a being climbed out from the potato .
Her family was very rich and a lot of men wanted to marry to her .
But there 's something that I 'd like to ask .
It will take place on Tuesday , March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall , from 10 : 00 AM to 7 : 00 PM .
As you know , I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents ' house . But that Sunday , I was driving when suddenly I saw on the shoulder one excellent car . It was a Jaguar with Will Smith in it . I stopped and asked if he needed some help , and he said , " Of course . "
My name is Sandra Atos , and I am writing to you because this last weekend I went to the theater you manage to see what was called " London 's newest and best musical show . "
Nowadays , we have different kinds of clothes that keep the temperature of our bodies , and clothes that do n't get wet or even dirty .
He fought in the Spanish Civil War and in World War II , always on the search for answers to questions like " ... What defines a man ? " or " ... What happens to us in critical situations ? "
To sum it up , the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group .
So you can see that it was not such a perfect evening for me as I thought .
It is my favorite group .
I received your letter last Monday .
However , it was closed for cleaning .
Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money . Usually , we spend much more money than we expect .
I am finishing my studies in June , then I have a month off ( July ) and on August 1st , I am starting a new job .
It 's brilliant , is n't it ?
This is important for everybody and I think this is important for them , too .
They said that it was n't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenery was being prepared for the concert .
Thank you for choosing our ticket at the final .
Her daughter , Lourdes Maria , is such a pretty little girl , that I could n't take my eyes off of her .
I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year .
Now I am 16 , and I have a nice baby boy .
It seems to be incredible , but these are common habits for us .
Actually it was terrible , and I would like to have my money back .
How 's your new flat ?
This is very stressful .
After that I prepared the group .
I would like to thank you for first prize .
Most of all , I 'm so happy that I could choose some activities .
And as new discoveries bring new discoveries , progress is going faster and faster .
