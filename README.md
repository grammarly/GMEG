abstract = { Until now, grammatical error correction (GEC) has been primarily evaluated on text written by non-native English speakers, with a focus on student essays. This paper enables GEC development on text written by native speakers by providing a new data set and metric. We present a multiple-reference test corpus for GEC that includes 4,000 sentences in two new domains (formal and informal writing by native English speakers) and 2,000 sentences from a diverse set of non-native student writing. We also collect human judgments of several GEC systems on this new test set and perform a meta-evaluation, assessing how reliable automatic metrics are across these domains. We find that commonly used GEC metrics have inconsistent performance across domains, and therefore we propose a new ensemble metric that is robust on all three domains of text.}

## Repository Contents

### Data
`data/` contains the dev and test splits, with a subdirectory for each domain
containing
* the original sentences (`source`)
* system outputs (`amu`, `lstm`, `lstm-r`, `marian`, `nus`, `transformer`)
* human corrections (`ref[0-3]`)
* negative control used for collecting human ratings (`source+error`)

Domains are `fce`, `wiki`, and `yahoo`.

`DOMAIN-corpus-scores.csv` has the mean human rating for each system for that domain.
`DOMAIN-segment-scores.csv` has the mean human rating by sentence for each system.

Data from the `yahoo` domain was sampled from the Yahoo Answers corpus, created from [L6 - Yahoo! Answers Comprehensive Questions and Answers version 1.0](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=l). This Yahoo Answers corpus can be requested free of charge for research purposes. Access to data from the `yahoo` domain will require you to first gain access to this Yahoo Answers corpus.

Once you have gained access to the L6 corpus, please forward the acknowledgment to Grammarly (peng.wang@grammarly.com), along with your affiliation and a short description of how you will be using the data, and we will provide access to data from the `yahoo` domain.
